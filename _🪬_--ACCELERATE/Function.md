## Function | Finalize Functionality

New Instructions:
"Review and enhance the existing application with the following priorities:

1. Core Functionality:
- Verify all existing features work correctly
- Test and maintain database connections and data flow
- Ensure all CRUD operations function as intended
- Validate form submissions and error handling
- Confirm authentication flows remain intact

2. UI/UX Refinements:
- Implement consistent spacing using a 4px/8px grid system
- Add subtle shadows (0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) to interactive elements
- Ensure responsive breakpoints at 480px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px
- Apply micro-interactions (hover states, transitions: all 0.2s ease)
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)

3. Visual Enhancements:
- Standardize component padding (16px-24px)
- Implement consistent border radius (6px-8px)
- Add depth through layering (z-index hierarchy)
- Optimize typography scale and line heights
- Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards

4. Performance Optimization:
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Minimize re-renders
- Implement proper error boundaries

Document all changes and test thoroughly before deployment. Maintain a development branch for these enhancements."

(Previous instructions = "I've created the Supabase backend and connected. Continue to Review and enhance the style elements and functionality, making micro improvements to the spacing/padding/margins/shadows/responsiveness/etc.

Ensure you maintain all functionality moving forward.

Increase the level of our esthetic styling, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and known in the ui-design space.

And accelerate your focus on Focus on building core functionality first. We'll prioritize working features while we enhance the UI/UX on the way to MVP completion.
Finish as much as you can correctly in the next go, ensuring that everything remains 100% fully functional while we're continuing to build out.")
