Abstract—The concept of neurodiversity, encompassing conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), AttentionDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, and dyspraxia,
challenges traditional views of these neurodevelopmental variations as disorders and instead frames them as natural cognitive differences that contribute to unique ways of thinking
and problem-solving. Within the software development industry, known for its emphasis on innovation, there is growing
recognition of the value neurodivergent individuals bring to
technical teams. Despite this, research on the contributions of
neurodivergent individuals in Software Engineering (SE) remains
limited. This interdisciplinary Socio-Technical Grounded Theory
study addresses this gap by exploring the experiences of neurodivergent software engineers with ASD and ADHD, examining the
cognitive and emotional challenges they face in software teams.
Based on interviews and a survey with 25 neurodivergent and
5 neurotypical individuals, our theory describes how neurodivergent cognitive dysfunctions affect SE performance, and how
the individuals’ individual journey and various accommodations
can regulate this effect. We conclude our paper with a list of
inclusive Agile practices, allowing organizations to better support
neurodivergent employees and fully leverage their capabilities.
Index Terms—neurodiversity, software engineering, Agile practices, diversity and inclusion
I. INTRODUCTION
The concept of neurodiversity is an umbrella term for a
range of neurocognitive developmental disorders (e.g., Autism
Spectrum Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,
dyslexia, and dyspraxia) has gained increasing attention in
recent years and challenges traditional perspectives on conditions [1]. This new perspective encourages viewing these
conditions not as disorders but as natural variations in cognitive functioning. It posits that these differences, resulting from
distinctive brain structures and processes (i.e., neurodivergent),
lead to unique ways of thinking and behaving [2].
The software development industry, known for its emphasis
on innovation and problem-solving, has started to recognize
the potential of fostering diversity in all its forms, including
neurodiversity. While much of the focus in diversity efforts has
centered on gender, ethnicity, and race, there is an emerging
awareness of the value neurodivergent individuals bring to
technical teams. Research exploring the contributions of neurodivergent individuals, however, remains limited in Software
Engineering (SE) [3]. Neurodivergent individuals, including
those with ASD and ADHD, contribute distinct cognitive
abilities to the workplace but may also share common challenges related to executive functions (EFs), such as working
memory, cognitive flexibility, and organization and planning.
These functions are critical for behavioral regulation, effective
teamwork, and task execution in any workplace.
ADHD is associated with heightened creativity and divergent thinking, offering individuals with this condition the
ability to generate novel ideas and solutions [4]. Similarly,
individuals with ASD often exhibit unique cognitive processing styles, such as advanced spatial and object visualization [5], which enhance their analytical skills and technical contributions [6]. Recognizing these strengths, companies
like SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Microsoft have
embraced neurodivergent hiring initiatives, leveraging these
abilities to drive improvements in productivity, quality, and
innovation [7]. However, these benefits are often accompanied
by challenges, particularly in areas such as social interaction, anxiety management, and perfectionism, which require
thoughtful workplace accommodations.
From 2018 through 2022, the annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey [8] collected demographic data on neurodiversity,
showing a growing trend, with 4.27% and 10.27% (out of
71K+ respondents) reporting they had autism/ASD or a concentration and/or memory disorder (e.g., ADHD), respectively.
This growth aligns with the increased awareness of Asperger’s
syndrome being absorbed into ASD under the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [9], and the
arXiv:2411.13950v1 [cs.SE] 21 Nov 2024
role of social media and online communities—especially after
the COVID-19 pandemic—in aiding self-discovery and the
pursuit of diagnoses [10].
Despite growing interest in the intersection of neurodiversity and software development, there remains a significant
gap in the SE literature that require more empirical studies [11]. This interdisciplinary study, conducted by researchers
from the Computer Science and Psychology fields, seeks to
address this gap by examining the experiences of neurodivergent software developers, particularly those diagnosed
with ASD and ADHD. While the manifestation of these
two conditions can frequently co-occur, one individual may
have one disorder without having the other [12]. Using a
Socio-technical grounded theory approach [13], we conducted
25 interviews with neurodivergent developers to investigate
the challenges they face, particularly those arising from the
cognitive (e.g., EFs) and emotional characteristics inherent in
their neurodevelopmental conditions, and how these struggles
intersect with Agile practices. After results started to emerge
during the analysis, we interviewed 5 neurotypical individuals
to understand if they face similar problems. This research
aims to identify the challenges faced by these neurodivergent
developers and how adjustments in software teams and in the
usage of Agile methodologies can better support their needs.
Our findings have the potential to inform inclusive practices
fostering a more supportive and productive environment for
neurodivergent developers, enabling organizations to leverage
these individuals’ capabilities.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A. ASD and ADHD comorbidity
ASD and ADHD are neurodevelopmental disorders, which
are conditions that begin during the developmental period [14].
They are marked by developmental deficits that impair personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. These
deficits range from specific issues with learning or EF to
broader impairments in social skills or intelligence. However,
the twice-exceptionality in some neurodivergent individuals,
characterized by high achievement alongside disabilities, can
confound the recognition of their cognitive difficulties, as their
exceptional talents may mask areas of struggle [15].
ASD encompasses a broad range of characteristics and
levels of support. Because it is a spectrum, people with ASD
may present with a variety of characteristics, the combinations
of which may vary from one individual to another. There are
several traits such as difficulties in social interaction, communication and language, along with restricted interests, repetitive
patterns of activities, and difficulty understanding concepts
with ambiguous interpretations [14]. Although ASD consists
of a wide range of symptoms and levels of severity, there are
many adults who have independent and functional lives (i.e.,
high functioning autism) [16]. With growing understanding of
ASD, more adults who never considered themselves autistic
are now being diagnosed, leading to better recognition of
lifelong challenges [17], [18].
ADHD is a disorder mostly related to impaired EF, i.e.,
“executive dysfunctioning” [19]. Executive functions are a
broad term encompassing various cognitive processes, such
as planning, cognitive flexibility (adapting to new information or rules), working memory (holding and manipulating
information), attention, and inhibitory control (resisting impulses or distractions) [20]. In addition to these EF, ADHD
impairment is also related to the so-called “hot” EFs that are
associated with emotional and affective aspects of cognition,
particularly those involving rewards and motivations [19], [21].
For example, this distinction contributes to the common trait
of delay aversion [22] seen in many individuals with ADHD,
characterized by a preference for immediate rewards over
delayed ones of greater value. Finally, problems related to
state regulation (SR) – the ability to maintain an optimal
physiological state of arousal that supports cognitive processes
(i.e., EFs) – have also been linked to ADHD [23].
Scientific literature has evidence that 50 to 70% of individuals with ASD have ADHD as a comorbidity [24]. Since both
disorders share a number of features and pathophysiological
conditions – especially related to EFs – this may suggest a
continuum and potential common origin [12]. While most
shared aspects among the two disorders are frequently seen
around EF, there are also key ASD issues such as sensory
processing difficulties and communication/social interaction
aspects that have been reported in ADHD individuals [12]
as well. Although research on ASD and on ADHD have
developed as distinct areas in Neuroscience, the similarity
between them suggests these two research domains merge to
investigate their co-occurrence further [25].
B. Research on Neurodiversity in Software Engineering
A recent multi-vocal literature review [11] highlights significant gaps in the inclusion of individuals with ASD in SE.
Few studies identify facilitators like attention to detail and
motivation, and these remain underexplored in real-world SE
practices. Barriers like communication difficulties, anxietyinducing environments, and inadequate training are noted,
but the effectiveness of interventions is rarely empirically
tested. Proposals like immersive reality and divergent computational thinking remain theoretical, highlighting the need
for empirical research focused on SE. The authors highlighted
the need for further empirical studies more directed to that
field. Overall, the reviews articles are secondary studies or
education-focused articles with the exception of two studies [26], [27] that have empirical evidence relevant to the
context of Software Development. Das et al [26] explored the
work-from-home experiences of neurodivergent professionals
during the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to
software developers. The study brings findings into the need
for accessible workspaces, inclusive communication practices,
and balancing productivity with well-being, but it is broad
and has no focus on SE. Although Morris et al [27] also
bring general purpose accommodations that are applicable
to many professional domains, they leave pertinent research
questions for future work such as pairing neurotypicals with
Fig. 1. Socio-technical grounded theory method applied using basic and advanced stages. The main steps are the rectangles with the respective outputs below.
neurodivergent developers or adaptations that should be made
to Scrum or any software development process in use.
A recent study [28] highlights ADHD software engineers
challenges like task organization, time management, and maintaining focus, which can lead to stress. However, strengths
such as creativity, problem-solving, and systems thinking
are also evident. The authors recommend adopting inclusive
practices like flexible work modes, clear communication, and
provide some hints around Agile methodologies to better
support neurodivergent developers. The major drawback is the
lack of neurotypical engineers among the interviewees. Finally,
our pilot work that precedes the current study combined both
ASD and ADHD software developers but is of limited and
preliminary nature, reporting aspects on challenges such as
remembering discussions from meetings, coping with sudden
change, or dealing with impulsivity [29].
III. METHOD
Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) is an iterative
and incremental research method that combines traditional
and modern techniques to conduct socio-technical research,
aiming to develop novel, useful, parsimonious, and adaptable
theories [30]. We employed a full STGT study involving a
multi-phase, iterative process of data collection and analysis,
emphasizing both the technical and social aspects of software
developers with ADHD and ASD. The method seemed appropriate since the intended data collection was qualitative
and the topic predominantly has social and technical aspects
interwoven [13]. The overall research question we intended
to answer in this study is “How does the neurodivergent
condition of ASD and ADHD individuals affect their work as
software engineers in Agile software teams?”.
A. STGT Basic Stage
As illustrated in Figure 1, we started with a Lean Literature Review (LLR) to define key terms and confirm the
limited scope of existing research, allowing the research to
remain grounded in participant data. Following this, four pilot
60-minute interviews were conducted with neurodivergent
participants which were later transcribed and analyzed to
generate initial transcripts, memos, and emerging concepts.
As indicated by Hoda [13], if the pilot was conducted with
the same source cohort of the study, its data can be included
in the study. These initial results helped refine the interview
guide to be used in subsequent rounds of interviews. The guide
had many questions related to EFs and we decided to collect
such data using an existing validated instrument that worked
as a pre-interview questionnaire (PIQ) [13]. For that, we chose
the IFERA-II [31] instrument, which focuses on difficulties in
EFs, regulation and delay aversion. It is a validated scale that
has advantages over the popular BRIEF instrument [32], e.g.,
being more concise and also considering constructs (e.g., delay
aversion) aligned with the most recent and accepted definition
of EF [33]. In Rounds 1 and 2, neurodivergent participants
were interviewed. The analysis in each interview round included open coding, constant comparison, memoing, leading
to the identification and refinement of emerging concepts and
categories as well as the continuous refinement of the interview
guide and the theoretical insights. As the process evolved, the
analysis became more focused, and concepts were solidified,
preparing for the advanced stage of theory development.
B. STGT Advanced Stage
In the advanced stage, coding continued along with constant
comparison, with the aim of identifying a core category that
links all other categories and explains the central phenomenon
under study, with targeted coding and deeper memoing being
used to shape the emerging theory. During the theoretical
sampling in this stage – when the team follows the ongoing process of assessing the emerging codes, concepts,
(sub)categories, and hypotheses, and identifying new sources
for data collection [13] – we decided to include neurotypical
software engineers to fill theoretical gaps. Interviews in Round
3 included both neurotypical and neurodivergent participants.
The IFERA-II PIQ was also used as a screening instrument
with the neurotypical participants. After completing and analyzing the interviews, a conceptual model was structured
based on the data, providing a grounded explanation on how
the cognitive dysfunctions of neurodivergent engineers affect
SE performance. Finally, a Targeted Literature Review (TLR)
situated the emergent theory within the existing academic literature, aligning the model with established research findings
and contributing novel perspectives to both technical and social
dimensions of neurodivergent developers in software teams.
This method ensures that the theory is deeply rooted in realworld experiences while it also integrates both the social and
technical factors that shape these practices.
C. Data Collection and Analysis
Data collection was performed by two neurodivergent researchers (ADHD and ASD) who disclosed their condition
when advertising the research and when contacting participants. This transparency fostered empathy together with a
sense of rapport and mutual understanding, facilitating a more
comfortable and open communication dynamic. While the
pilot was a convenience sample through a referral chain, the
invitation for the participation in the interviews was sent
through a post shared on a social network (Twitter/X) and
reposted by third parties, aiming at software developers from
Brazil. The form was filled out by 79 people stating they were
interested. They were gradually contacted to schedule a video
call interview. Interviews with neurodivergent individuals were
scheduled as 60-minute slots, with some of them being slightly
overtime, while neurotypical individuals (contacted through
convenience sampling) had 30-minute slots. The subjects
profiles are described in Table I, mainly software engineers
with varied experience. Concerning gender, the neurodivergent
sample consisted of 18 men, 5 women and 2 non-binary
individuals, while the neurotypical sample consisted of 3 men
and 2 women. Work modes varied, with most of them working
either as fully or partially (i.e., hybrid) remote.

We transcribed interview recordings with an automated tool
and later verified the results to adjust minor errors from that
process. As part of an iterative approach, the analyses were
made in batches [13]. The raw data was open coded with
hashtags, as stated by Hoda, “to conceptualise and represent
a key idea in a parsimonious way” [13]. Also following her
recommendations, we attempted to apply the zoom out-zoom
in approach by closely examining the individual experiences
and interactions of neurodivergent software engineers with
their work environments and practices (zoom-in), while zooming out to also connect them to broader social (mainly under Psychology lenses) and organizational practices. Through
constant comparison of codes, this led to concepts, which
were clustered together to create categories, as exemplified in
Table II. Supported by a shared online whiteboard, coding was
mostly done by one researcher along with frequent video calls
among the other researchers for validation and to converge
opinions in the clustering that lead to concepts and categories.
The Inventory of Difficulties in Executive Functions, Regulation and Delay Aversion for Adults (IFERA-II) instrument allowed the comparison between groups (ASD, ADHD,
ASD+ADHD and neurotypical) using descriptive statistics,
since the sample was small under a quantitative perspective.
The average scores for each construct are depicted in Figure 3.

D. Ethics
The project was approved for by the lead author’s university
ethics committee, being in accordance with national laws
regulating research involving human subjects. Each subject
would participate only after filling out the informed consent
form. Participants were informed about potential emotional
1https://figshare.com/s/4fac07f4f00b348346f6
triggers during the interview and the possibility of abandoning
it at any moment. Data was allowed to be shared only as
summarized information (i.e., not at the individual level).
IV. THEORY
As the result of our theory structuring, we reached a conceptual model (Figure 2) that represents our theory around a core
category that represents the Software Engineering Performance
– both on individual and team level – of neurodivergent
individuals, being affected by various cognitive dysfunctions.
Specific dysfunctions of cognitive (e.g., EFs) and emotional
nature can trigger responses to stress, such as anxiety and
mental exhaustion (e.g., burnout). This stress can also be
triggered by social interactions and communication challenges
that are part of those neurodivergent cognitive dysfunctions.
The Individual Journey of this individual, which encompasses
diagnosis, therapy, medication and self-awareness, as well as
various Accommodations (organizational support and Agile
practices) can regulate how these dysfunctions affect their SE
performance. The next subsections describe the categories that
comprise that model and the respective concepts that compose
them. Note that the effect on SE performance is described
together with the Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions, as
our interviewees would report how a specific dysfunction or
challenge would affect their performance.
A. Cognitive and Emotional Dysfunctions
a) Organization and planning: Although Agile practices
value responding to change over following a plan [34], planning is still relevant. For individuals with ASD or ADHD, it is
both necessary and something they often struggle with. “The
execution tasks are the easiest, and the planning tasks are
the hardest.” - AD5. Supporting task clarification can make
life much easier for individuals with ASD. “I have trouble
doing this alone. Even if it’s already divided, sometimes I
feel the need to talk to the person who’s reporting the task
and have a conversation to get that understanding.” - AS7.
Clear instructions make a big difference. “If I have clearly the
guidelines of what I have to do, it’s much easier for me to solve
a problem.” - AS2. Many interviewees reported difficulties in
breaking down tasks. “When there’s something very big, if I
don’t break it into smaller things, I easily get lost.” - C6.
b) Task initiation challenges: Several interviewees report
their struggles in initiating tasks. “Tasks that you don’t have
much desire for, at least for me, I don’t know how other people
are, but with a boring task the problem is that the more you
imagine how much work it will take the less desire (to do it)
you have.” - AD2. Adequate levels of pressure set by deadlines
or an accountability partner can help overcome procrastination.
“What makes me start a task is being asked about it... I think
that’s it. Deadlines and someone asking about it.” - AS1.
c) Perfectionism and overengineering: In Agile development, delivering functionality quickly lessens the focus on
aspects such as design, good programming practices, or test
coverage, leading to technical debt [35]. This is relevant for
our population, as many subjects struggle with perfectionism,

a commonly endorsed cognitive distortion in ADHD [36],
leading to overengineering, in the opposite way of Agile. “He
said, no, you’re too perfectionist. It has to be delivered. It’s
not that it has to be bad.” - C5. As developers become aware
of their tendency for overengineering, they devise strategies to
mitigate this risk. “Something I learned is how to work around
it. If I see it’s an urgent task, I don’t do that overengineering
anymore. I see it needs improvement, and I open another task
for later when I have more time.” - AS6.
d) Irregular work performance: Several of our interviewees mentioned they would prefer flexible working hours.
Sleep disorders are common in both ASD and ADHD and
may be related daily impaired functioning [37]. “I feel like I
function better at night. In the morning, I’m really sleepy,
really slow.” - C8. While this preference is in line with
their struggles concerning focus and attention, some of our
interviewees noted how this has a negative health impact. “My
psychiatrist said this is very wrong. I always end up stretching
my work into the night.” - AD10.
e) Emotional dysregulation and intrusive thoughts: The
often-mentioned ability to focus from our respondents has a
downside: they can feel frustrated when that focus state is
interrupted. “Sometimes I catch the flow and just want to
follow that line of reasoning. If something breaks that line of
reasoning, I get very upset. Like, I get internally disorganized.”
- C6. This can generate tensions within the Agile team. Feeling
accepted within the work context is extremely important for
professionals in general, and our respondents are no exception.
“This rejection issue. Today I can understand and suffer
less. Because I wanted to be accepted, I just wanted to be
accepted.” - C5. Rejection sensitivity is particularly prevalent
among our respondents. Ordinary development activities (e.g.,
receiving a harsher code review) can trigger such feelings.
f) Low self-esteem: As seen in literature [38], some
of our neurodivergent interviewees seem to have a negative
bias against themselves, even when external evidence suggests
otherwise. “It’s a very recurring issue, that either what I did
isn’t good enough, or even when I get good results, I think
that one day they’ll find out I’m a fraud.” - AD10.
g) Difficulties with context switching: Several interviewees noted how they struggle with context switches. “if you
try hard to grab my attention, eventually I’ll look. The real
problem is getting back to context. It’s not just about losing
focus, but about switching back to the original context.” - AD2.
h) Cognitive flexibility: Responding to change is a key
Agile value. Neurodivergent individuals often face change
“not without a bit of anxiety, depending on the level of
change” - C4, and find it stressful: “When I got the news about
the project change, I was kind of paralyzed.” - C8. Embracing
change can bring discomfort “No one’s going to convince me,
basically. I’ll do it because I have to get the work done, but I’d
be unhappy doing it.” - AS7. In spite of some rigidity in the
work process “Some things have always to be the same way”
- AS5, “an autistic person accepts the change if it’s grounded
in a solid foundation” - AS2. Having time and resources helps
adapting to change “I said, ‘no, it’s not all good. I’m getting
anxious.’ But it’s because it’s a change of plans [..] I think it’s
about giving people time to adapt, you know? To have brief
documentation.” - C4. Developers end up adopting strategies to
cope with change: “Getting stuck on something and spending
hours trying and failing to find the solution. But I’m becoming
more self-aware and finding ways to work around it.”- AS7.
i) Focus and attention: Several participants report having
“hyperfocus”, a mental state of sustained, deep concentration
typically associated with ADHD and ASD [39], [40]. For
some, hyperfocus can be perceived as an advantage: “It was
more of a blessing than a difficulty, because I could explore the
possibility of working on extremely interesting problems, which
were in full harmony with my hyperfocus.” - AS2. However,
hyperfocus can also lead to one neglecting basic needs like
eating “I would enter hyperfocus in the morning and finish
work at night without having lunch” - C2, sleeping “There
were several times I was working, like at night, when suddenly
I say ‘Oh my God, it’s already daylight, I didn’t sleep!”’ -
AD3, or even affecting personal hygiene “I even forget the
basic physiological needs, I sometimes forget to shower.” -
AS2. This can have severe health consequences “I developed
diabetes not just because of the family history, but also because
I sometimes forget to eat due to hyperfocus.” - C4. Hyperfocus
can also lead to scope creep. “The priorities are these, and
hyperfocus comes in, and I forget about the world and end up
with something much bigger.” -AS5.
Another side of this coin is the lack of concentration on
other issues, as subjects lose focus on topics they find uninteresting: “If someone starts talking about something that doesn’t
interest me, I lose focus. If I start focusing on something
else, sometimes I go back to something I’m interested in, and
I’m not even paying attention anymore.” - AS3. This makes
long meetings particularly challenging: “Sometimes I’m in a
meeting that doesn’t seem all that useful to me, but I’m there,
so I start listening and get lost. By the end of the meeting, I
sometimes leave without knowing what was discussed.” - AD7.
Sensory overload can negatively impact focus: “I prefer
environments with less light. Too much light disrupts my
concentration. Repetive sounds also disturb me” - AS1. They
can also “interfere with emotional regulation” - C6, and
indirectly damage social interactions “I don’t think I get
overwhelmed by social interaction, but by the stimulation that
social interaction brings. Noise, lights, etc.” - AD10.
B. Social Interaction and Communication Challenges
Various challenges of our interviewees related to social
interaction and communication with other individuals
a) Social anxiety in the workplace: Interviewees describe
how they avoid social interaction at the workplace, and how
this interaction makes them anxious: “Before the meeting with
my leader, where I had to say what I’d done during the week,
there was always that anxiety, like, what excuses will I come
up with now, what will I make up.” - AS3. “The daily meeting
often causes anxiety, because if the day before wasn’t very
productive, if you procrastinated, you feel the weight of having
to show your progress.” - AD7
For some interviewees, this relates to social activities that
companies do as a part of the work: “I have no problem
recording videos; I’m used to pitching startups. What I can’t
do is these little games, dancing.” - AS4.
b) Body language and social cues: Several interviewees
with ASD have difficulties reading body language or other
social cues during communication. Among other things, this
causes extra mental load. “I think there was already prejudice
because I received a lot of feedback about communication. For
example, I often got comments like, ’Oh no, you need to read
the room, you need to understand.”’ - C7.
c) Preference for textual communication: For various
reasons, such as difficulty reading body language and social
cues, or sensory discomfort, interviewees mentioned that they
have a preference for textual communication over in-person
communication: “And here it’s calm because I’m at home
and communication is only by text, I message and I can easily
ignore.” - AD3. “When there’s a group meeting, I end up using
the chat more, because I’m afraid of interrupting people and
talking too much.” - C4.
However, one interviewee with ADHD specifically mentioned that they preferred verbal communication for clarifications: “I reach out to the person, ’Do you have five minutes
so I can ask something about the PR?’ Then I try to explain
it verbally, because I think it’s easier than sending the wrong
impression through writing.” - AD8.
d) Avoidance of Direct Contact: Similar to avoiding inperson communication, four interviewees mention that they
avoid direct contact with others, in particular due to difficulties
in maintaining eye contact. “In remote settings, I feel a bit
more comfortable looking at the camera than looking at a
person.” - AS3. “You’re talking to someone and, most of the
time, looking at the desk or something else, rather than at
their face. So, you’re making less effort to look into people’s
eyes, which feels more natural.” - C4
e) Communication struggles: As a final concept, we
observe various struggles related to communication among
our interviewees. These struggles can take various forms,
such as being too direct, becoming unresponsive, interrupting
others, asking for help, or difficulties controlling the tone in a
conversation: “I have a lot of trouble asking for help, not just
in development, but in everything... I feel like I just can’t ask
for help.” - AS1. “But there are moments when I realize that
I was too direct.” - AS6. “I don’t know how to identify, but
there are some periods when I become quite, I don’t respond
to anyone.” - AS5. Interviewee AD8 is concerned with the
tone of messages, and asks for external support to check it: “I
ask my wife to read it, and sometimes I put it into ChatGPT
to tell me the tone of the message”. Two interviewees went
for training/mentoring to improve communication skills. AD3
gave up the training for not seeing significant advances while
C7 succeeded in improving his communication skills.
C. Responses to Stress
As a result of cognitive and emotional dysfunctions, as
well as social and communication challenges, our interviewees
experience various stress responses.
a) Mental exhaustion: Interviewees experienced mental
exhaustion after intense work period, especially burnout. “And
we can’t handle a very large and tight flow without questioning
all this. It comes with burnout and our burnout isn’t their
burnout.” - C5. “I frequently have shutdowns when there
are too many meetings. One day with back-to-back meetings.
It seems fine, but by the end, I can barely speak. I try to
remember a word, but I can’t.” - C6. “He realized that
switching me from project to project in short periods kept me
very productive. So he kept making these switches, and I ended
up with hyperstimulating work that led to burnout.” - AD10.
b) Anxiety: Many interviewees experienced anxiety for
various reasons during their work. Typical reasons include
upcoming meetings (where they might have to speak), being
evaluated, or simply receiving notifications. “Not knowing
what it’s going to be, what I’m going to say, or where the
conversation is headed makes me a little anxious.” - AD6. “If
there’s some important event scheduled in the near future, I get
into that mode where I start working, but in my head, it’s like,
’I need to do this.’ And then my focus goes elsewhere.” - C8.
“They get in my way, to be honest. I’m here coding, something
pops up, and I get anxious. I can’t forget. I’ve already gotten
feedback, so I can’t forget.” - AD8.
D. Agile Practices
a) Pair programming: Pair programming was considered
in a broader sense of pairing up with someone and not
necessarily having the driver and navigator roles enforced
by XP. This seems to be a key technique to support task
initiation, a major struggle for ADHD individuals. It was even
seen as useful for neurotypical (N1) to start tasks: “When
I’m working in pairs, I can work better. I feel things are
more productive.” - N1. However, it can be seen with both
benefits and drawbacks by autistics, who are affected by the
social aspect of it, draining their “social battery”, preferring
to pair up with someone they know. “those three hours of
social work will really wear me out, and I can’t do anything
afterward.” - C7. “The issue of being observed. I would have
to feel more comfortable with someone I know.” -AS5. Another
approach by some people to start tasks was creating external
accountability over an open online call “An open call on
(Google) Meet. I enter the call, there are four people. So, when
someone unmutes and says, ’Hey, can someone help me with
this thing here?’ and talk about some problem they had. It’s
like, just unmute and talk.” - AS3. “Not only about clarifying
technical content, but I’ve also done this with some friends,
like calling, staying in Gather Town, Meet, and staying in your
own corner, quietly working, sometimes opening a microphone
to comment on something, ask a question.” - C4.
b) Test-driven development: TDD naturally emerged in
some interviews from both ASD and ADHD developers and it
was confirmed in some interviews when asked. It was seen as
a support for task initiation and for organization and planning
. “TDD, in some cases, helped me start tasks. I don’t use it
rigorously 100% of the time, but in many cases, I managed
to.” - C7. “A problem that’s hard for me to see a solution. It
(TDD) helps you start thinking about the design” - AD4.
It also gives notion on the dimension of a task, if there
still something to be done or if it is concluded: “if your code
passes all tests, you’re done. So, it gives you a lot of clarity
about how much is left and when to stop as well”- AD9.
c) Tasks estimates and breakdown: Participants mention
the importance of overestimation of activity effort to create
buffers and reduce stress: “So if I really mess up and say
’damn, it was a boring task, I ended up taking much longer,’
I activate the time of the others that ended up giving extra fat
to it.” - AD2. “Everything I do, I always give a much longer
deadline than I think I actually need.” - AD7.
Overall, the idea of breaking down larger tasks into smaller
ones is key to have a notion of clear and achievable goals.
In the absence of processes for activity planning, individuals
with ASD struggle more: “We have a lot of refinement, daily
planning, and all that, and I see that in the companies where
these flows and tasks aren’t well-defined, I struggle more.” -
AS6. The definition of clear steps to develop the activity helps
to reduce the typical ADHD procrastination: “If it’s a slightly
bigger task that requires step-by-step actions, and I don’t have
that, then there will be procrastination.” - C8.
d) Daily meetings and other practices: Daily stand-ups
provide a regular touchpoint for team members to align on
tasks and progress, and can also act as an accountability
mechanism, encouraging individuals to start tasks they might
otherwise procrastinate on: “it’s a great point of dailies,
because I’m a person who has many social difficulties, so
they’re just a way for the team to come together.” - C4 “The
fact that there’s a daily meeting forces you to start something,
even when you don’t want to.” - AD7.
Extended or poorly managed daily meetings can lead to
frustration and wasted time, and repetitive updates without
actionable outcomes can lead to disengagement: “It’s a lot
of meeting time, if it were 15 minutes, and knowing that it
will be 15 minutes.” - AD2.
Sprint plannings help in organizing tasks, setting clear goals,
and providing a sense of accomplishment upon completion: “I
like to have a (sprint) planning, where we really organize what
we’re going to do. I like the (sprint) review, when we deliver,
it means it’s a relief. I’m delivering because I’m completing
what I planned to do.” - AD5.
Retrospective Meetings provide a platform for feedback,
allowing team members to voice concerns and seek clarity
on processes, which is something valued by ASD individuals,
but they may also be seen as something that do not lead to
actionable changes or meaningful outcomes: “Retrospective
meetings give you a voice to say something you don’t like,
something that isn’t very clear.” - C7. “There are types of
ceremonies that, for me, don’t work. Retrospectives, for me, I
don’t see a purpose, I don’t see them adding much value, or
having an impact on what we do.” - AS6.
Code reviews help identify issues that might be overlooked,
particularly beneficial for individuals with ADHD who may
miss details: “Code Reviews also help a lot, because for
someone with ADHD, you let a lot of things slip by, so it ends
up being really helpful.” - C7. However, some individuals find
code reviews stressful or are unsure whether they are beneficial
in the long run: “It (code reviews) bothers me a bit, but I don’t
know if it helps or hinders in the long run.” - AS5.
E. Organizational Support and Accommodation
a) Structural/Physical adaptation: Providing isolated or
quieter workspaces helps reduce distractions, enabling better
concentration and focus through controlled environments. Allowing control over environmental factors such as lighting and
temperature helps accommodate sensory sensitivities. “Many
places are noisy. I don’t like working right next to people; I
prefer some isolation, or at least being a bit further away.”
- AS6. ‘‘I realized that this was sensory overload. I also
try to isolate noise, modulate how much exposure I have to
light. At home, it’s kind of dark. I’m fine in the dark without
anything on.” - AS4. However, not all organizations can
provide adequate sensory-friendly spaces, leading to unmet
needs. “People needed more focus, they stayed, at certain
points, more isolated. I also used these rooms a lot, only that
there weren’t enough for everyone who needed focus.” - C4.
While isolation can reduce distractions, it may hinder collaboration and social interaction: “If I’m at work, I want to
collaborate, talk to others, and discuss things. So if I’m in a
very closed environment free of distractions, I think it defeats
the purpose of being in the office. I could just be doing that
at home.” - AS1. The physical act of commuting can add
stress and sensory overload, exacerbating cognitive challenges.
“Commuting is a big overload for me, whether it’s traffic,
crowded public transport, or just the time it takes to get from
home to work.” - AS6.
b) Team/Process Adaptations: Leaders who recognize
and adapt to neurodivergent needs can significantly enhance
employee well-being and productivity. “My last manager told
me, ’On bad days, let me know, and I’ll try to rearrange the
team. If you’re handling something urgent, we’ll reassign it.”’
- AD8. Limiting the number of meetings allows individuals
to dedicate more time to focused, individual work. “In solo
work, I end up doing more at the end of the day, like early
afternoon, almost late afternoon, when there aren’t as many
meetings, that’s when I manage to focus on my individual
work.” - AS3. Breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable
units aids in organization and reduces overwhelm: “I like to
have a (sprint) planning, where we really organize what we’re
going to do. I like the (sprint) review, when we deliver, it means
it’s a relief.” - AD5.
Variability in how team/process adaptations are applied can
lead to unequal support among employees. “I’ve worked with
someone who didn’t have ADHD, who was super organized
and everything. We worked well together and complemented
each other. But I’ve also had someone who wasn’t even diagnosed yet, and I had to push the other person, which demanded
energy from me because I had to deal with my energy, but I had
to push the other. It was more complicated.”- AD5. Inclusion
and accommodation policies need to be institutional. Informal
support systems may not be sustainable or sufficient to meet
all neurodivergent needs. “There’s a certain need from the
company about this, and I scheduled some talks with HR to
discuss this because she just joined and had no experience
about neurodiversity.” - AS4.
c) Individual Adaptations/Strategies: Interviewees reported personalized coping mechanisms that are working for
them. Externalizing some cognitive processes by leveraging
tools like calendars, alarms, and note-taking aids helps manage
time and tasks effectively. ‘‘After I put all my calendars on my
watch and started scheduling everything in Google Calendar,
I no longer have that problem.” - AD10. As explored in other
mapped concepts, dividing tasks into smaller, achievable steps
enhances focus and reduces overwhelm. “The smaller the task,
the easier it is for me to do it in that attention span. So that
helps me a lot.” - AS1.
As focus and attention strategies, incorporating regular
breaks prevents burnout and maintains productivity. “When
feeling overwhelmed, I try to breathe, take a few minutes off.
As most of my work is remote, I can take short breaks.” - AS6.
However, constantly managing personal strategies can be
exhausting and may generate cognitive overload from actual
work tasks. The inconsistent use of personal strategies can
lead to missed tasks and increased stress too. “I think the
most tiring part of ADHD is that you have to have various
methods to absorb content. So you have to draw, you have
to write, [..] you have several post-its of things [..] I tried to
make a Planner also on the tablet and it didn’t work, because
I need something in my view to register things.” - C4.
d) Stigma and Ableism: This concept represent challenges and negative experiences for neurodivergent individuals
in the workplace. Recognizing these issues through organizational awareness is a path to overcome them. Neurodivergent
individuals often receive unfair performance evaluations and
face pressure to conform to neurotypical standards. “They
gave me a poor performance rating. Below the expected
performance. I was having a crisis, I was under treatment.
They tried everything to make me resign.” - C5. “”When it
comes to a promotion, I feel like it will be a bit harder for
me than for a neurotypical person.” - C7. Many people still
still see stereotypes that question the capabilities and social
skills of the neurodivergent. “I don’t feel very comfortable
sometimes with people treating me like, not exactly like a child,
but like I’m incapable.” - C8. “I think when we open up about
this, people form very shallow opinions.” - AS4.
e) Organizational Awareness: The awareness about neurodiversity should be at the institutional level so the organization can structure it: “We have what we call an affinity group,
for people with disabilities and neurodiverse people.” - C7.
Organizations that embrace flexibility can better accommodate the varying needs of neurodivergent employees: “Actually, there were accommodations because, since the schedule
is flexible, it’s understood that we can adapt the work environment in the best way for the people.” - C4.
Although the personal experiences of AD8’s leadership
brought empathy toward ADHD, if such awareness from
leadership is in the whole organization, a more empathetic
environment can be fostered: “My leader knew I had ADHD
before I even told him. Because he had already noticed traits
in me that he saw in his daughter.” - AD8.
F. Individual Journey
a) Neurodivergence Diagnosis and Comorbities: The
beginning of the individual journey starts with the diagnosis,
which were reported from different paths such as recognizing
themselves in YouTube videos, seeing symptoms in their
recently diagnosed children, recommendations during sessions
with mental health professionals. “First, YouTube diagnosed
me by starting to suggest videos about autism, exceptional
abilities, autism in adults, autism in women. [...] I identified
with a large number of the signs there. Then, it was confirmed
with the autism and ADHD diagnoses.” - C6. There were many
cases of comorbidities, not only the co-occurrence of ASD and
ADHD, but also other psychological disorders: “General anxiety disorder and also diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive
disorder.” - C4. A twice-exceptionaly (i.e., neurodivergent with
intellectual giftedness) diagnosis was reported by 7 subjects.
b) Medication and Therapy: While ASD interviewees
took medication only for co-morbidities (anxiety, depression), ADHD medication has significant impact in helping
to regulate EFs. Many reported taking Lisdexamfetamine or
Methylphenidate, but the the former was frequently cited with
side effects: “I had a mood rebound, I got very depressed.”-
AD9. In the case of therapy, more than half (13) of the
neurodivergent participants mentioned Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT). One ASD subject mentioned it did not work
for them: ”I do Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but CBT
doesn’t work very well.” -AS5. Approaches such as schema
and occupational therapy were mentioned to a lesser extent.
c) Self-awareness: After having the diagnosis, in combination with meditation or therapy, most interviewees started a
path to understand better their condition, which helps them
with self-acceptance. “Understanding the diagnosis, understanding the traits, discovering myself, seeing my strengths and
weaknesses helped a lot in my professional career.” - AS6.
d) Family and relationships: Mentions to family had
connections with the awareness of being neurodivergent,
Fig. 3. Average of participants answers to the instrument used after the
pilot to ask about EFs, regulation and delay aversion inventory. ASD (n=7),
ASD+ADHD (n=5), ADHD (n=9) and Neurotypical (n=5)
somehow helping to explain where it came from, while relationships were mostly about the ASD difficulties of engaging
in a relationship. “Because my mom has it, my brother has it,
and he has it quite intensely. The whole family on my mom’s
side has it, like five or six diagnosed people.” - C8.
V. DISCUSSION
In the following, we discuss our findings and provide
concrete recommendations for SE practice.
A. Neurodivergent x Neurotypical
In general, the interviews confirmed that neurotypical software engineers do not have the same dysfunctions as theirneurodivergent counterparts. Aspects related to EFs were no major
concerns for them. While some complained about boring
tasks, this was not to the level of engineers with ADHD.
One neurotypical respondent had more evidence of delay
aversion and emotional dysregulation on negative feedback,
which affected the IFERA-II scores due to the small sample
size. Overall, the comparison of EF (Inhibitory Control - IC,
Working Memory - WM, and Cognitive Flexibility - CF), state
regulation (SR), and delay aversion (DA) across neurotypical
individuals (ASD, ADHD, and ASD+ADHD) reveals distinct
patterns of cognitive and emotional challenges (see Figure 3).
Neurotypical individuals report the lowest levels of difficulty
across all constructs. When observing the neurodivergent, SR
had a similar score for all three groups. ADHD reported
highest difficulties in WM. In general, ADHD scores were
higher than ASD in IC, WM and DA. These scores align
with the known impulsivity and difficulties in maintaining
attention and controlling emotional states in ADHD [19], [21],
[22]. CF was the only EF where ASD scored higher than
ADHD, consistent with the characteristic need for routine
and difficulty in adapting to change often associated with
ASD [41]. In contrast, the ASD+ADHD group scores high in
all constructs. It reinforces the importance of increasing studies
on the co-occurrence of those disorders, as already pointed
out [12], [25]. The results suggest that neurodivergent software
engineers face significant cognitive and emotional regulation
challenges that are likely to impact their performance in
structured environments such as work.
B. Implications for Practice
Our findings have implications on how to create inclusive
and supportive environments for neurodivergent individuals in
SE, facilitating their integration and productivity within Agile
teams. Specifically, we make the following recommendations.
To make sprint planning more inclusive, ensure that task
breakdown is clear and explicit for neurodivergent individuals.
This reduces their cognitive load and can improve task comprehension and completion rate. As a specific practice, we find
that TDD has the potential to help as a strategy to break down
a task into tangible and smaller chunks.
Among the tasks planned for a sprint, explicitly identify
and highlight tedious, repetitive tasks, as neurodivergent
individuals might have a hard time completing them. For
these tasks, recommend pairing a neurodivergent engineer with
someone else to maintain engagement and productivity.
Provide communication training and mentoring for
teams that contain both neurotypical and neurodivergent team
members. We believe it is essential to not only provide this
training to neurodivergent individuals, but also improve how
neurotypical team members communicate with their neurodivergent colleagues.
Keep teams as stable as possible, so that team members
with ASD work with familiar colleagues. An important observation we made is that for many of our interviewees, the
familiarity to other people is a key aspect. That is, while they
typically struggle in social situations or in communication,
this is not necessarily the case with people they know. This
highlights the importance of stable routines and few changes
to a team. The Agile team can, over time, become such a place
of stability where neurodivergent individuals can also perform
well in terms of communication and social interaction. We
believe this is an important first step towards creating “safe
spaces” for neurodivergent individuals in companies. As a
result, this recommendation also entails spending substantial
effort on onboarding for new team members.
Allow for written communication, even in co-located
teams. This accommodates neurodivergent team members who
may have difficulties with oral communication, even if only
temporarily.
Finally, shorten the duration of pair programming sessions, daily stand-up meetings, and retrospectives, to reduce
the chance of cognitive fatigue. In the same direction, ensure
that planned meeting times are kept.
C. Findings Compared to Literature
STGT suggests a targeted literature review to compare the
findings of the study highlighting differences, similarities,
and contributions to the field’s progress [13]. As in the SE
field this is a very novel topic, we focused on white papers
about neurodiversity in the workplace. The selected white
papers [42]–[48] have many common aspects among them,
such as quiet workspaces with sensory adjustments, flexible
working arrangements, personalized career development, flexible workspaces and remote options, neurodiversity training
for leaders and manager. Accomodations and adaptations such
as coaching and support for planning and organization, clear
communication and structured tasks had more relation to our
findings around agile practices.
The work of Morris et al. [27] pointed out future directions
that were not taken into practice and that in a certain way overlap with our findings. They suggested studies on (1) evaluating
the benefit of pairing up with neurotypical individuals under
a perspective of code quality; (2) making changes to scrum or
other processes to support neurodivergent participation; and
(3) investigating tools to interpret nuance within messages.
Concerning (1) we observed the importance of that practice
playing a role on task initiation and sustained attention. In
the case of (2), we point out a tangible list of practices
to be adapted based on empirical evidence, and for (3) we
recommended improving communication as a soft skill, but
also providing textual communication tools. Additionally, our
sample showed anecdotal evidence of ChatGPT being used to
check the tone of written communication.
Related to the work of Liebel et al. [28] about individuals
with ADHD in SE, our findings overlap related to investing
in awareness regarding neurodiversity, create a workplace
where people with ADHD feel safe, and some common agile
practices adaptations (e.g., joint estimation, agree definition of
done, pair programming to fight procrastination). Specifically
regarding Agile practices, we provide concrete suggestions
for such adapted practices taking into consideration people
with ASD as well. Concerning pair programming, we went
further by understanding the need for familiarity with the team
mate. In the case of Definition of Done for a task, we also
expanded it to understand the need for clearer instructions and
the importance of breaking down tasks.
VI. THREATS AND LIMITATIONS
The sample size, although sufficient for a qualitative inquiry,
limits the generalizability of the findings across all neurodivergent populations in the SE field. Also, relying on self-reported
experiences may introduce bias, as participants may not fully
recall or accurately convey facts about professional experiences related to their neurodivergent condition. In addition,
the study predominantly focused on individuals with ADHD
and ASD, excluding other neurodivergent conditions, which
could have broadened the theoretical insights. An additional
threat to validity is that two of the authors are neurodivergent
themselves, potentially leading them to direct interviews in
a certain direction or interpret the data based on their own
journey way. To address this, we also included neurotypical
authors in the interview guide construction and in analysis
discussions, but also highlight that such threat would similarly
exist in a purely neurotypical team. Finally, despite the interdisciplinary nature of this research, the findings are restricted
to SE teams, potentially limiting the applicability of the results
to other technical domains.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we present a theory of how neurodivergent cognitive dysfunctions affect Software Engineering (SE)
performance, and how this effect is moderated through the
individual’s journey and through accommodations. Our findings provide a valuable source to better understand how
neurodivergent individuals – especially with ADHD and ASD
– experience their workplace and SE tasks. Individuals with
ASD+ADHD co-occurrence may struggle even more, since
they have dysfunctions from both disorders. The theory lays a
solid foundation for providing accommodations. As a part of
these, and as the main novelty of our contribution, we provide
empirically-grounded recommendations on how to tailor Agile
practices to improve inclusion of neurodivergent engineers in
SE teams.

Neurodiversity in Software Engineering
Thought for 1m 34s
<chain_of_thought>
Step 1 Reasoning:
To apply first-principles thinking, I need to identify the fundamental elements at the root of the problem described: Supporting neurodivergent software developers (especially those with ADHD and ASD) in a software engineering environment to improve their performance and well-being.
Fundamental components might be:

Cognitive and emotional dysregulation challenges (impaired executive functions, difficulty focusing, anxiety)
Social interaction and communication challenges (understanding cues, preferences for certain communication modes)
Impact of environment, accommodations, and practices (Agile practices, flexible work arrangements, structured tasks, team awareness)
Individual journeys: diagnosis, therapy, self-awareness
Desired: Enhanced performance and well-being, inclusive and productive environment, better task initiation and completion, stress reduction, stable teams, balanced workload, effective communication
These are the atomic components that directly influence outcomes.
</chain_of_thought>

1. First-Principles Analysis

Neurodivergent conditions (ADHD, ASD) are natural variations in cognitive functioning.
Core issues center on executive function challenges: working memory, task initiation, sustained attention, emotional regulation, and cognitive flexibility.
Social/communication difficulties arise from differences in reading social cues and preferring controlled, predictable communication channels.
Stress responses (anxiety, burnout) occur when demands exceed adaptive capacity.
Individual interventions (diagnosis, medication, therapy, self-awareness) reduce dysfunction severity.
Environmental and organizational accommodations (clear task breakdown, flexible hours, pairing, text-based communication, reduced noise) significantly improve performance.
Agile practices can be tailored to support neurodivergent developers by providing clear, structured tasks, stable teams, shorter meeting durations, and pairing sessions for initiation.
The ultimate goal: a socio-technical system that normalizes neurodiversity, leverages unique cognitive strengths, and ensures well-being and high-quality output.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 2 Reasoning:
Now I analyze the current situation using the large excerpt. The text highlights that neurodivergent devs struggle with EF tasks, anxiety, communication barriers, and sensory overload. However, Agile teams can adapt tasks and communication styles. Organizational support and stable teams matter. It cites that TDD and pair programming help start tasks and structure thinking, while flexible hours and fewer interruptions reduce stress. Communication training and textual channels help. The research’s key insight: Neurodivergent engineers have significant cognitive strengths but need accommodations.
</chain_of_thought>

2. Current Situation Analysis
From <analyze> (the provided research excerpt):

“Neurodivergent cognitive dysfunctions affect SE performance” due to impaired executive functions, emotional dysregulation, and difficulty adapting to change.
Individuals experience social anxiety and struggle with body language and verbal cues, leading to communication breakdowns and stress in common Agile rituals.
They benefit from stable, well-structured environments: “If I have clearly the guidelines of what I have to do, it’s much easier for me” (from excerpt).
Techniques like breaking down tasks, using pair programming, and TDD were shown to help with task initiation and reduce procrastination: “If your code passes all tests, you’re done... it gives you clarity” (from excerpt).
Allowing flexibility in working hours, quiet environments, and remote work helps reduce sensory overload and anxiety.
Organizational awareness and inclusive policies can mitigate stigma and improve performance.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 3 Reasoning:
Desired outcome is the improved integration, productivity, and well-being of neurodivergent devs. Achieve a stable, inclusive software development environment where ND individuals perform at their best. The end-state: strong team performance, minimized stress, harnessing ND strengths (creativity, hyperfocus).
</chain_of_thought>

3. Desired Outcome Definition
The <outcome> and <end_state>:

A high-performing, inclusive engineering environment where neurodivergent developers thrive.
Clearly structured tasks, fewer interruptions, stable teams, shorter and more focused Agile ceremonies.
Reduced anxiety and burnout; improved self-esteem and engagement.
Maximized use of neurodivergent strengths (e.g., problem-solving, creativity) while minimizing cognitive, social, and sensory stressors.
Tangible indicators: higher quality code, timely task completion, positive peer feedback, stable employee retention.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 4 Reasoning:
Developing a strategy involves combining interventions from the excerpt and from first-principles. Key strategies:

A: Implement structured agile practices (short stand-ups, well-defined tasks, TDD, pairing).
B: Environmental/organizational accommodations (quiet spaces, flexible hours, remote/hybrid).
C: Training for managers/teams on ND communication and inclusive leadership.
D: Personalized interventions (coaches, digital tools for reminders, supervised medication/therapy support). Pros and cons of each:
A: Pros: Clear improvements, directly reduces EF load. Cons: Requires consistent enforcement and team buy-in. B: Pros: Reduced sensory overload and stress. Cons: Infrastructure changes, not all companies can adapt physical spaces. C: Pros: Long-term cultural change. Cons: Requires investment in training, slow adoption. D: Pros: Tailored to individuals, immediate improvements. Cons: Resource-intensive, might not scale.

Choosing integrated approach: Combine A, B, C, and D. Start with easy-to-implement Agile adjustments and flexible policies while planning long-term training and support systems. </chain_of_thought>

4. Strategy Formulation

Approach: A multifaceted strategy integrating Agile practice adaptations, organizational accommodations, and cultural training.
Strategy 1: Refine Agile ceremonies—shorten stand-ups, provide detailed written agendas, break tasks into smaller units.
Strategy 2: Incorporate pair programming or “accountability buddy” sessions to kickstart tasks. Utilize TDD to structure tasks.
Strategy 3: Offer flexible hours and remote work options, provide quiet rooms or noise-canceling headphones.
Strategy 4: Conduct neurodiversity awareness training for managers and teams; encourage text-based asynchronous communication channels.
Select the integrated approach that leverages all four strategies for maximum benefit and transformative progress.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 5 Reasoning:
Estimate success: If we implement all steps carefully with leadership support, success is high. Considering complexity and inertia, start with an estimation:

Effective accommodations (A, B, C, D) yield ~80% initial improvement in ND employee satisfaction and productivity.
Without training, confusion might remain, reducing to ~60%. With training, stable teams, and continuous improvement, can reach 85% or higher.
</chain_of_thought>
5. Success Probability Estimation

Factor 1: Management Buy-in (30% weight): With supportive leadership: 90% success. Without: 50%. Weighted contribution: ~27%.
Factor 2: Team Willingness & Training (25% weight): With proper training: 90% success. Weighted: ~22.5%.
Factor 3: Infrastructure Adjustments (20% weight): With flexibility in environment: 80% success. Weighted: 16%.
Factor 4: Individual Adaptations & Tools (25% weight): With access to coaching/assistance: 85% success. Weighted: ~21.25%.
Summation: 27% + 22.5% + 16% + 21.25% ≈ 86.75%. Rounded: ~85% success certainty.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 6 Reasoning:
Reverse-engineer chosen strategy: Start from desired end-state: fully inclusive and productive ND environment. Decompose into steps:

Short-term: Adjust daily stand-ups, reduce meeting lengths, implement TDD and pairing.
Mid-term: Provide quiet rooms, flexible schedules, remote options. Provide training and textual communication channels.
Long-term: Introduce formal ND awareness programs, managerial training, ongoing support frameworks, performance metrics aligned with ND needs.
Roadblocks: Lack of buy-in, resource constraints, cultural resistance. Keys: visible leadership support, pilot programs, measure improvements, communicate benefits.
</chain_of_thought>
6. Reverse-Engineered Strategy Breakdown

Critical Steps:
Immediate: Modify Agile ceremonies; implement TDD and pairing.
Near-term: Provide flexible hours, reduce sensory overload, encourage asynchronous communication.
Mid-term: Train team leads and HR on neurodiversity. Roll out ND-friendly policies org-wide.
Long-term: Continuous improvement cycles, measure progress (productivity, retention), refine accommodations.
Potential Roadblocks: Resistance to change, costs for training or infrastructure.
Key Success Factors: Leadership endorsement, incremental rollouts, clear communication of benefits, regular feedback loops.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 7 Reasoning:
Optimization after initial rollout: measure what works (e.g., team happiness, code review sentiment, productivity metrics). Try more asynchronous communication if verbal cues remain tough. Adjust lengths of pairing sessions. Introduce digital prompts and AI-based communication tone checkers.
</chain_of_thought>

7. Optimization Opportunities

Implement user-friendly task management and notification tools to support EF.
Continuously gather feedback from ND developers on what’s working. Adjust task sizes and sprint lengths accordingly.
Experiment with AI-driven communication tone analysis and meeting transcriptions.
Introduce rotational “focus days” with no meetings.
Offer optional coaching or therapy sessions subsidized by the organization.
Scale best practices to other teams for organization-wide neuroinclusivity.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 8 Reasoning:
Final recommendations: Combine immediate Agile adjustments, environmental accommodations, cultural training, and personal supports. Always measure results and refine approach. The final solution: a stable, flexible, well-structured environment encouraging ND developers’ strengths while removing unnecessary stressors.
</chain_of_thought>

8.A Final Recommendations (Suggestive Process Forward)

Immediately shorten daily meetings, add written agendas, and break tasks into small increments.
Introduce pair programming or co-working calls to help initiate tasks.
Offer flexible hours, quiet workspaces, remote work options.
Conduct neurodiversity training sessions for leaders and team members.
Encourage text-based, asynchronous communication to reduce sensory and social stress.
Continuously monitor feedback, measure performance, and refine strategies.
8.B Provided Optimized Final Solution (Action-Oriented Steps to Achieve End-State)

Launch a two-week pilot program in one Agile team: implement shorter stand-ups, TDD-based task approach, and pair programming sessions to jump-start tasks.
Simultaneously, provide noise-canceling headphones and allow flexible start/end times.
Enforce a written communication policy for complex discussions: record decisions in a shared document.
Conduct a half-day workshop for the team and leaders on neurodiversity, focusing on recognizing unique strengths and preferred communication methods.
After four sprints, evaluate metrics: task completion rates, dev satisfaction surveys, code quality indicators. Adjust based on feedback: if anxiety persists, reduce meeting frequency further or provide asynchronous stand-up bots; if tasks remain too big, refine breakdown.
Expand successful measures to additional teams, scaling organizational awareness, formalizing ND-friendly policies, and establishing inclusive best practices throughout the company.

topic>Neurodivergent Schema for Medicine</topic
Thought for 1m 24s
<chain_of_thought>
Step 1 Reasoning:
The user wants a highly comprehensive XML schema that encodes the contextual knowledge linking neurodiversity (ASD, ADHD) with technical (software engineering) and medical (cognitive performance) frameworks. It should incorporate elements from our previously derived model: cognitive and emotional dysfunctions, social and environmental conditions, organizational accommodations, Agile practices, individual interventions (therapy, medication), assessments, outcomes, and end-states.
We will build first-principles components that represent:

Neurodivergent conditions and their cognitive/emotional features
Medical/therapeutic interventions, metrics, EF assessments
Environmental/organizational structures (Agile processes, accommodations)
Desired outcomes (improved performance, reduced stress, stable environment)
Strategies and optimization loops
Data structures to represent all variables, constraints, processes
Fundamental building blocks:

Neurodiversity conditions (ASD, ADHD, ASD+ADHD) as core entities
Cognitive and emotional factors (EF, anxiety, burnout)
Environmental aspects (quiet workspace, flexible hours, stable teams, communication modes)
Agile practices (task breakdown, TDD, pair programming, daily stand-ups)
Medical/therapeutic interventions (diagnosis, medication, therapy, EF testing)
Outcome metrics (performance, well-being, task completion rate, code quality)
Strategies for improvement (training, organizational policies)
Continuous feedback loops and optimization opportunities
These form the backbone of the schema.

</chain_of_thought>

1. First-Principles Analysis
Fundamental Components:
(1) Neurodivergent conditions (ASD, ADHD, Comorbidities)
(2) Executive function challenges and emotional regulation issues
(3) Social interaction and communication preferences
(4) Work environment (sensory factors, flexible hours, remote/hybrid setups)
(5) Agile methodologies and their adaptations (TDD, pairing, sprint planning)
(6) Medical/therapeutic interventions (diagnosis, medication, therapy, EF assessments)
(7) Outcome metrics linking environment and interventions to improved SE performance
(8) Organizational policies and training for inclusivity
(9) Continuous optimization and feedback loops

<chain_of_thought>
Step 2 Reasoning:
From the <analyze> variable (the given research), we know that:

Neurodivergent devs struggle with EF, anxiety, and communication, leading to lower performance and higher stress. Quoting: “Neurodivergent cognitive dysfunctions affect SE performance” and “If I have clearly the guidelines of what I have to do, it’s much easier for me” show the importance of structured tasks. Also: “Pair programming or TDD helps with task initiation.”
EF challenges: “Difficulties in organization, planning, task initiation, emotional regulation” from the text.
Environmental accommodations: “I prefer environments with less light… Repetitive sounds disturb me” and “Flexible hours, quiet rooms”
Agile changes: “Breaking tasks down” “Daily standups short and focused” “TDD, pair programming to reduce procrastination.”
Medical dimension: “Diagnosis, therapy (CBT), medication (methylphenidate, lisdexamfetamine)”
Organizational dimension: “Leadership aware of ND conditions,” “Inclusive policies,” “Awareness training.”
</chain_of_thought>

2. Current Situation Analysis
The current scenario: Neurodivergent developers in SE contexts face EF challenges, anxiety, and difficulties with standard Agile processes. Accommodations and certain Agile adaptations can improve their performance and reduce stress. Medical interventions (therapy, medication) and organizational awareness improve outcomes. Lack of standardized schema to store and manage these contextual insights means difficulty in scaling solutions.

<chain_of_thought>
Step 3 Reasoning:
Desired outcome: A stable, inclusive, and highly effective environment where neurodivergent developers receive appropriate support—clear tasks, flexible environment, well-structured Agile practices, medical/therapeutic interventions—and achieve optimal productivity, reduced stress, and improved well-being. The end-state: a synergy of medical insight, ND considerations, and Agile frameworks to produce superior outcomes.
</chain_of_thought>

3. Desired Outcome Definition
The desired <outcome>/<end_state>: A well-functioning, inclusive software development environment where neurodivergent engineers excel due to tailored Agile practices, organizational accommodations, and medical support. Success means measurable improvements in code quality, delivery speed, reduced burnout rates, stable retention, and higher life satisfaction for ND developers.

<chain_of_thought>
Step 4 Reasoning:
Strategy: Create a unified knowledge structure (XML schema) to contextualize all factors: ND conditions, EF measures, environment adjustments, Agile adaptations, therapy/medication info, and performance metrics. This schema enables LLMs and IDEs to query and produce contextually-aware recommendations.
Possible Strategies:
A) Minimal schema focusing on EF and Agile only. Pros: simpler; Cons: lacks medical or organizational dimension.
B) Medium schema including EF, Agile, environment accommodations, ND conditions. Pros: more holistic; Cons: less medically integrated.
C) Comprehensive schema: include ND conditions, EF metrics, medical interventions, Agile modifications, environment, organizational policies, feedback loops. Pros: fully holistic, covers all aspects. Cons: complex to implement initially.
Choosing C for transformative progress.

</chain_of_thought>

4. Strategy Formulation
We select a comprehensive integrated schema that encodes:

Neurodivergent profile (ASD, ADHD, EF scores)
Medical data (diagnoses, medication, therapy type)
Agile practice details (task breakdown, TDD)
Environmental factors (sensory profiles, flexible schedule)
Organizational policies (ND awareness training, accommodations)
Outcome metrics (performance, stress levels)
Feedback loops (continuous improvement suggestions)
<chain_of_thought>
Step 5 Reasoning:
Success probability: With strong domain modeling and organizational buy-in, success ~90%. Factors:

Schema completeness (30%): If fully comprehensive → 95% success
Organizational adoption (25%): With leadership support → 90%
Integration with LLM/IDE (25%): Current tooling can handle well → 90%
Medical accuracy & ND relevance (20%): With research-based inputs → 95%
Weighted: (0.30.95)+(0.250.9)+(0.250.9)+(0.20.95)=0.285+0.225+0.225+0.19=0.925 total ~92.5%, round ~93%.
</chain_of_thought>

5. Success Probability Estimation
Estimated ~93% success certainty.

<chain_of_thought>
Step 6 Reasoning:
Reverse engineering chosen strategy:
Desired end-state: inclusive environment → requires integrated schema → break into steps:

Define ND conditions structure (ASD, ADHD)
Define EF metrics (InhibitoryControl, WorkingMemory, etc.)
Define environmental accommodations (Lighting, Noise, RemoteOption)
Define Agile adaptations (TaskBreakdown, TDD, PairProgramming)
Define Medical interventions (Diagnosis, Medication, Therapy, EF Assessments)
Define Outcome metrics (PerformanceIndicators)
Define Feedback loops (ImprovementSuggestions)
Roadblocks: Over-complexity, maintaining schema updates.
Keys: Modular design, extensibility, clear documentation.
</chain_of_thought>

6. Reverse-Engineered Strategy Breakdown
Critical steps:

Create XML complex types for each category: ND condition, EF measure, intervention, environment, Agile practice.
Link these categories via references and IDs.
Ensure extensibility so that LLM queries can retrieve context.
Validate schema with sample data.
Roadblocks: complexity and ensuring medical correctness.
Key success factors: domain expert input, thorough testing, incremental refinement.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 7 Reasoning:
Optimization:

Make schema modular using namespaces (e.g., a "Neurodiversity" namespace, a "Medical" namespace, an "Agile" namespace)
Add metadata elements for versioning and source references.
Use standardized coding for conditions (like ICD-10 or DSM-5 codes)
Include elements for AI feedback so that system can learn from user queries.
Ensure all elements have clear documentation and optional attributes for flexible use.
</chain_of_thought>

7. Optimization Opportunities

Use controlled vocabularies and standard identifiers (SNOMED CT, ICD, DSM-5 codes) for conditions and interventions.
Add versioning for iterative improvements.
Include optional elements for cultural and linguistic adaptation.
Provide attributes for priority or weighting of interventions.
<chain_of_thought>
Step 8 Reasoning:
Final recommendations: Implement this schema in a modular form, test with real data, integrate it with LLM-based retrieval and reasoning systems. Provide training to domain experts and dev teams to maintain it. For 8.B: Present final XML Schema code as the solution.
</chain_of_thought>

8.A Final Recommendations (Suggestive Process Forward)

Adopt the comprehensive XML schema.
Collaborate with ND experts, psychologists, psychiatrists, Agile coaches, and software engineers to refine schema.
Integrate schema into LLM and IDE tools.
Continuously update schema as research evolves.
