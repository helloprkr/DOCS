Create a comprehensive implementation plan for the software functionality, ensuring all features are fully operational and thoroughly tested before deploying to the cursor environment. Include specific milestones, testing protocols, and acceptance criteria. The plan should detail:

1. Required functionality components
2. Dependencies and integration points
3. Testing scenarios and expected outcomes
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Rollback procedures
6. Success metrics
7. Defined End-State and required steps to achieve it
8. User logic and flow, with all the steps and logic to achieve the end-state
9. Proper diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate the logic and flow of the software functionality
10. Fail-safe and bullet-proof Step-by-step buildinstructions for our AI-Coder, optimized for effienct and defined updates/changes/additions to our application/code through a series limited prompt-cycles.


Format the response as a structured implementation roadmap with clear timelines and ownership assignments. Flag any potential risks or technical constraints that could impact the cursor deployment.
