# Obsidian: The King of Learning Tools (FULL GUIDE + SETUP)
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/hSTy_BInQs8

00:00:00.080 almost a year ago I started building
00:00:02.280 this you can call it a personal network
00:00:04.720 of knowledge but you might know it as a
00:00:06.440 zetto Casten or a second brain after
00:00:08.719 years of searching for the perfect
00:00:10.400 approach to my learning I think this is
00:00:12.200 it by far it's been the most valuable
00:00:14.200 asset for reading for writing and even
00:00:16.320 for my thinking but before I hype it up
00:00:18.320 to you and show you how to make your own
00:00:20.519 there's something I should warn you
00:00:21.560 about a hidden danger it's one that left
00:00:23.359 me incredibly frustrated when I first
00:00:25.439 started to make my own it was a pain in
00:00:27.400 the ass to get started and I mean that
00:00:29.320 if you look up how to create a zetoc in
00:00:31.679 obsidian or how to build your second
00:00:33.399 brain you'll find probably hundreds of
00:00:35.559 videos with each person showing their
00:00:37.239 own method and their own way of doing it
00:00:38.840 and don't get me wrong some of these
00:00:39.920 were great like I used them to build my
00:00:41.559 own and I couldn't be here without them
00:00:43.680 but the problem is as I kept watching
00:00:45.360 more and more videos I was digging
00:00:47.280 myself a trap one that would be harder
00:00:49.239 and harder to eventually climb out of
00:00:51.320 when I had to every single YouTuber I
00:00:53.120 watched had their own method of creating
00:00:54.719 it one that was slightly different to
00:00:56.120 the next and if you end up watching 10
00:00:59.079 or 20 of these
00:01:00.559 you start to pick out points from every
00:01:02.320 single one and then it fills you with
00:01:04.199 this almost toxic sense of perfectionism
00:01:06.799 for example I'd find some nice features
00:01:08.520 from one video and then watch another
00:01:10.040 video and they have something different
00:01:11.360 that stands out to me like a shiny gem I
00:01:13.759 take that and then that process repeats
00:01:16.159 and if you combine all their points from
00:01:17.600 all these videos you end up with this
00:01:19.080 mess this Frankenstein's monster of a
00:01:21.240 setup that tries to be everything but
00:01:23.560 fails I was deluded in doing that I
00:01:26.040 thought I could steal from everyone
00:01:27.360 else's workflow and make the perfect one
00:01:29.400 but that's not how how it works in fact
00:01:31.040 all it did was bug me down for months I
00:01:33.280 didn't really do much writing I was just
00:01:35.079 obsessed with getting the perfect setup
00:01:37.280 which doesn't exist anyway but
00:01:38.759 thankfully I eventually realized that
00:01:40.840 this system was never going to be
00:01:42.280 perfect in fact every time I added a new
00:01:44.799 feature I was only adding a pointless
00:01:47.200 gimmick that was a distraction from the
00:01:48.960 true work the writing and without
00:01:50.960 wasting more time I just gripped my
00:01:52.439 teeth and moved forward with what I had
00:01:53.960 already I abandoned all the weird
00:01:55.560 gimmicks the plugins and all the
00:01:57.159  features that didn't actually
00:01:58.759 matter and I focused on on the Bare
00:02:00.280 Bones and suddenly a weight was just
00:02:02.079 lifted off my shoulders it felt good
00:02:04.000 because now I can actually do what I
00:02:05.479 wanted to do which was to write I didn't
00:02:07.560 have to worry on finding the perfect
00:02:09.080 system and optimizing every single step
00:02:11.000 of the way I do realize now I'm just an
00:02:13.040 extra voice in the conversation but I
00:02:14.840 just want to reassure you and say that
00:02:16.480 this setup is free from there
00:02:18.640 are no pointless features there are no
00:02:21.640 gimmicks this setup is simple it's
00:02:23.720 minimalistic it focuses only on the key
00:02:25.959 features that actually help you get to
00:02:27.680 where you want to be and I have the
00:02:28.879 experience to vouch for this system I've
00:02:30.640 used obsidian for I think 9 months now
00:02:33.480 almost every day and since the start
00:02:35.680 after hundreds of notes it hasn't
00:02:37.560 changed the setup is exactly the same
00:02:40.120 and to me that's solid evidence that it
00:02:42.440 works so if you're feeling intimidated
00:02:44.360 by the idea of starting your own I get
00:02:46.319 you I was in that same position but I
00:02:47.959 hope this setup can free you of some of
00:02:49.480 that stress and really give you the
00:02:50.920 building blocks you need to just get
00:02:52.159 started if you want an immediate walkthr
00:02:53.879 and how to set it up then please do skip
00:02:55.560 to that but for this next portion of the
00:02:57.400 video I want to talk about why should
00:02:59.519 you do this anyway like what's in it for
00:03:01.239 you it seems like a lot of effort and it
00:03:03.200 is but I want to cover three main
00:03:04.920 benefits that make it so powerful as a
00:03:07.159 learning tool over the years I've tried
00:03:08.760 many learning techniques cuz I was sick
00:03:10.519 and tired of walking away from my books
00:03:12.319 the same person forgetting all the
00:03:13.920 important things and failing to reflect
00:03:15.799 on what was inside it was exhausting and
00:03:17.760 I felt like all the efforts I put into
00:03:19.239 the learning was just Vanishing Into
00:03:20.720 Thin Air and it was all for nothing this
00:03:22.480 all changed when I read a book called
00:03:24.159 How to take smart notes by sunin now I
00:03:27.280 think that's how you pronounce it but do
00:03:28.599 correct me for German this is the book I
00:03:30.400 chose to bring on a 3-hour flight and I
00:03:32.799 thought it would just be a casual
00:03:34.439 laid-back experience on you know maybe
00:03:36.159 how you can make your notes a little bit
00:03:37.560 more effective I was so so wrong by the
00:03:40.480 time the plane landed the course of my
00:03:42.159 entire reading from that point would
00:03:43.799 change forever those 3 hours I was just
00:03:46.040 captivated by what I was reading cuz
00:03:47.519 this was revolutionary I had never
00:03:49.280 thought of note taking and learning
00:03:51.040 quite like this this book tore down lots
00:03:53.000 of misconceptions I got from traditional
00:03:54.959 education and it gave me this fresh and
00:03:57.040 exciting perspective to reading it was
00:03:58.959 the idea of a Casten a slip box which is
00:04:01.879 exactly what we're building today now I
00:04:03.480 do recommend you check his book out cuz
00:04:04.959 it is really good but to keep it brief
00:04:07.000 the zetto Casten is a note taking system
00:04:09.560 that builds your notes from the bottom
00:04:11.040 up it let you take the ideas you read
00:04:13.159 and embed it in this network of
00:04:14.560 knowledge one that serves you in all
00:04:16.199 your goals from learning to reading to
00:04:18.000 writing there's three main ways it's so
00:04:19.759 so effective and almost unlike any other
00:04:22.360 note taking system the first reason is
00:04:24.280 that it forces you to slow down now a
00:04:26.440 lot of people don't like to hear that
00:04:27.880 all the hustle grinds set Bros they
00:04:29.320 don't like the idea of abandoning speed
00:04:30.960 reading and they might hate me for
00:04:32.280 saying this but it's true in most cases
00:04:34.960 speed and reading are not a good mix the
00:04:37.400 best thing I ever did for my reading was
00:04:38.840 to slow it right down and take thorough
00:04:40.840 notes in the process the slowness of the
00:04:42.600 writing forces you to dwell on the
00:04:44.120 author's ideas of course it's slower you
00:04:46.240 do lose speed but to me that's a worthy
00:04:48.479 sacrifice because all the ideas will
00:04:50.520 have a lasting impact on your mind it's
00:04:52.320 like when you eat too much at Christmas
00:04:53.840 and you sit there all stuffed and
00:04:55.280 Bloated and you have to really wait and
00:04:57.600 digest to be able to come to life again
00:05:00.240 this is kind of the same thing but with
00:05:01.840 your brain the result is not only a way
00:05:03.800 better attention of what you read but
00:05:05.199 you also start to understand things more
00:05:07.000 deeply because you know some of these
00:05:08.440 books are chunky and it's not like you
00:05:10.280 can speed through them and just remember
00:05:11.880 everything the second power of the zal
00:05:13.680 Casten is that it gives you instant
00:05:15.320 feedback on your learning I'm not sure
00:05:16.960 how it works in the USA but in the UK we
00:05:19.319 have this thing called a levels and
00:05:21.199 that's 2 years of study before going to
00:05:22.960 University and you can pick three or
00:05:24.680 four subjects for that and I did history
00:05:26.880 and in history there was a lot of essay
00:05:28.560 writing we did essays almost every week
00:05:30.560 now normally you hand in your essay and
00:05:32.199 you get feedback a week later but let's
00:05:34.440 say there was a Twist this time every
00:05:36.120 time I handed this essay in I would
00:05:37.880 never get any feedback if that pattern
00:05:39.800 continued for a year or two I would get
00:05:41.520 to the end of my a levels and my essay
00:05:43.759 writing would be just as as when I
00:05:45.319 first started because to get better at
00:05:47.199 any skill you need two things you need
00:05:49.039 practice and you need feedback now in
00:05:51.039 that case I had lots of practice I wrote
00:05:52.720 every week no problem there but I didn't
00:05:54.800 get any feedback and if there's no one
00:05:56.440 there to correct you you're going to end
00:05:57.560 up making the same stupid mistakes again
00:05:59.840 and again and again writing notes is the
00:06:01.800 exact opposite of that situation because
00:06:03.759 by doing that we get instant feedback by
00:06:05.880 writing we get an instant reflection of
00:06:07.639 our own understanding because if we
00:06:09.240 struggle to put something into words
00:06:11.160 then that's a sign that we haven't
00:06:12.440 understood it it's a sign for you to go
00:06:14.120 back to the book and check your
00:06:16.039 understanding this is a prime example of
00:06:17.639 the fame and technique in action which
00:06:19.360 says that if you teach something in this
00:06:21.680 case writing you actually learn it
00:06:23.759 better yourself the third benefit of
00:06:25.479 this system is that you allow your notes
00:06:26.960 to form connections most people store
00:06:28.960 their notes by subject in these clear
00:06:30.919 subdivided folders now this makes sense
00:06:32.840 in our head we've been taught to do it
00:06:34.560 in school but there's actually hidden
00:06:36.319 danger to it because it has the tendency
00:06:38.080 to isolate your ideas and that stops you
00:06:40.080 from seeing the bigger picture you'll
00:06:41.639 see what I mean with the example and
00:06:43.000 it's going to sound really weird at
00:06:44.160 first but bear with me why are reptiles
00:06:46.039 mostly in hotter areas of the world it's
00:06:48.000 because they're ectotherms which you
00:06:49.599 probably know as cold blooded now this
00:06:51.520 means to effectively hunt and Escape
00:06:53.560 Predators they have to warm up using the
00:06:55.280 environment like when a lizard sits on a
00:06:57.199 rock to absorb the energy of the Sun but
00:06:59.599 because we're mammals we can produce our
00:07:00.960 own heat from within but this is
00:07:02.400 expensive because unlike lizards we have
00:07:04.360 to eat a lot more to keep ourselves warm
00:07:07.280 well the hidden strength that we have as
00:07:08.960 mammals is that we can stay active even
00:07:11.120 in the cold if you travel North to the
00:07:13.080 Arctic as a lizard it's going to be so
00:07:15.080 cold that you can't properly move and
00:07:17.160 you end up either starving or dying to a
00:07:19.560 predator but since we produce our own
00:07:21.240 heat we can stay active and that means
00:07:23.280 we can avoid predators and also hunt
00:07:25.360 effectively we can out compete the
00:07:27.080 reptiles even in the coldest
00:07:28.639 temperatures our okay that's that but
00:07:30.879 let's slow down a second why am I giving
00:07:32.759 you a biology lesson I gave you a simple
00:07:34.800 explanation of that topic but if you
00:07:36.280 want to understand it in depth you have
00:07:38.240 to know things from chemistry from
00:07:40.000 physics from biology from ecology to
00:07:42.919 understand the bigger picture you have
00:07:43.960 to pull ideas from all four of these
00:07:45.879 subjects and if you fail to understand
00:07:47.720 something in that chain of reasoning you
00:07:49.360 might not get the whole thing in that
00:07:50.960 same example if you have no idea why
00:07:52.879 muscles slow down when they're cold then
00:07:54.759 you won't be able to explain that
00:07:56.240 properly to me but there is hope because
00:07:58.039 if you understand the physics and the
00:07:59.680 chemistry and the biology you can
00:08:01.440 somehow piece everything together into
00:08:03.280 this clear picture and you can
00:08:05.319 understand it and you can explain it to
00:08:06.639 me this is true wisdom this is the end
00:08:09.080 result of learning the most valuable
00:08:10.680 thing you can achieve and this system
00:08:12.520 this zetto Casten is exactly how you'll
00:08:14.479 get there the second major benefit of
00:08:16.560 the zto Casten is how it helps you store
00:08:19.080 and mix ideas before I started taking
00:08:21.199 notes like this I would write all of the
00:08:23.039 things I learned in separate notebooks I
00:08:25.159 love the feeling of pen on paper because
00:08:26.960 you can be free with it and you can draw
00:08:28.560 all the diagrams you want it's
00:08:30.039 satisfying now this was all well and
00:08:31.599 good but as I was a few notebooks in I
00:08:33.958 started to realize a problem that was
00:08:35.839 creeping up on me how the hell am I
00:08:37.360 going to manage this later am I going to
00:08:39.200 end up with 100 notebooks like what do I
00:08:41.519 do then so I made the painful decision
00:08:43.519 to overhaul everything and prevent This
00:08:45.480 Disaster it may have hurt in the moment
00:08:47.200 but I knew that this physical method of
00:08:49.040 notetaking was going to hurt me in the
00:08:50.600 future and it had its limits with
00:08:52.600 obsidian the app we're using today all
00:08:55.080 of your notes are in the same place
00:08:57.399 whenever and wherever you need them
00:08:59.040 instead of of carrying 100 notebooks or
00:09:01.079 flash cards you have your whole personal
00:09:03.040 library on your phone or computer and if
00:09:05.519 you store your note files on the cloud
00:09:08.000 you can literally travel across half the
00:09:09.519 world and you'll still be able to find
00:09:10.800 them even though I love taking notes on
00:09:12.440 paper this is the obvious best choice
00:09:14.240 nowadays so the storage of notes is
00:09:16.000 already perfect but there's an extra
00:09:17.519 benefit of having everything in one
00:09:19.120 place it's the power of connecting ideas
00:09:21.200 to make new ones in this system like we
00:09:23.200 said before your notes are free from the
00:09:25.320 restrictions of folders this means you
00:09:27.160 don't have to go through the annoying
00:09:28.680 process of open opening 10 different
00:09:30.360 subfolders to find that exact note you
00:09:32.560 were looking for in this system they're
00:09:34.079 all in one Arena they're all free to
00:09:36.200 mingle and to connect insights from
00:09:38.120 Socrates Dante and the Bible can connect
00:09:40.360 with those from maybe Virginia wolf or n
00:09:43.040 or any other modern author you can think
00:09:44.600 of every new book video and article you
00:09:46.720 read can add something valuable to the
00:09:48.320 conversation something that can form
00:09:50.279 these exciting connections that you
00:09:51.640 never saw coming your network of notes
00:09:53.480 only get stronger with time and you
00:09:55.079 can't say the same for a system of
00:09:56.480 folders because the more you add the
00:09:58.279 more messy and confus it gets this is
00:10:00.560 the exact opposite and I know what you
00:10:02.000 might be thinking this looks chaotic it
00:10:04.079 looks messy it's ugly and I will admit
00:10:06.680 mine is uglier than most people's online
00:10:09.040 without a system of tags and hyperlinks
00:10:11.160 it is a mess and it is hard to navigate
00:10:13.160 but if you follow some basic rules in
00:10:14.720 how you construct the notes and organize
00:10:16.880 it it's actually really easy to then
00:10:18.560 navigate this Maze and find exactly what
00:10:20.519 you're looking for and I'm not giving it
00:10:21.880 enough credit here because sometimes you
00:10:23.560 write a note and then months down the
00:10:25.600 line you completely forget it exists but
00:10:28.160 because of your system of links
00:10:29.839 you end up rediscovering it by accident
00:10:32.040 and it's the nicest surprise and here's
00:10:34.000 the nice part if you're more of an
00:10:35.360 organized type of person which you know
00:10:37.200 I am too I like folders this system
00:10:39.639 still caters to you if you use tags you
00:10:41.560 can add this extra layer of organization
00:10:43.519 to your notes and if you want to find
00:10:45.320 something related to a specific topic
00:10:47.160 it's still easy and if it sounds
00:10:48.560 confusing no worries because we're going
00:10:50.040 to walk through these steps in detail a
00:10:51.440 bit later on the third major benefit is
00:10:53.519 easier and faster writing and this is by
00:10:55.839 far my favorite one it's so exciting to
00:10:57.639 talk about when I first read about this
00:10:59.000 idea in how to take smart notes I swear
00:11:01.200 I almost got goosebumps because at the
00:11:03.800 time I knew this was big this would
00:11:05.680 change how I WR forever the best way to
00:11:07.680 show you this is to compare two
00:11:09.160 different writers our first writer has
00:11:11.040 an idea for a book and you know he's got
00:11:12.760 a rough idea of the structure so all he
00:11:14.480 has to do now is set out to research
00:11:16.480 whenever he finds a useful idea he just
00:11:18.360 takes it and puts it in his planning
00:11:20.120 draft he then uses subheadings to sort
00:11:22.160 it out and see what will go where after
00:11:24.079 many long hours lots of caffeine and
00:11:26.720 maybe an existential crisis or two he's
00:11:29.000 finished fin the book that sounds all
00:11:30.639 good right well yeah maybe for now but
00:11:33.200 you'll see he's screwing himself over in
00:11:34.959 the future our second writer also wants
00:11:36.880 to write a book but he starts without an
00:11:38.880 idea for the title he doesn't know what
00:11:40.600 the end product might be instead he just
00:11:42.440 reads about whatever he's interested in
00:11:44.240 and on the way he picks up the ideas
00:11:45.800 that resonate the most with some simple
00:11:47.680 organization of his notes he begins to
00:11:49.399 see these areas of Interest form around
00:11:51.639 certain Topics in the case of obsidian
00:11:53.639 this can be literal clusters that begin
00:11:55.240 to form for example the more he reads
00:11:57.040 about human behavior the bigger the area
00:11:58.959 of disc discussion gets and before he
00:12:00.480 knows it he's got the building blocks
00:12:01.839 for a book with a quick look through the
00:12:03.440 notes the writer sees how he can order
00:12:05.320 them in a linear way now all it takes is
00:12:07.519 some rearranging some editing and of
00:12:09.399 course a little bit of extra writing but
00:12:11.200 then suddenly you have a book it was a
00:12:13.160 relatively quick process because most of
00:12:15.040 the writing was already done in the form
00:12:16.920 of the notes way before the idea of the
00:12:18.880 book even existed the first writer
00:12:20.880 didn't have this opportunity and he's
00:12:22.560 also missing out on a second benefit
00:12:24.360 because the second writer collected his
00:12:25.839 ideas outside of the book draft he can
00:12:28.079 reuse these notes as many times as he
00:12:29.839 wants in all sorts of different projects
00:12:31.959 in other words none of his research is
00:12:33.680 stuck within the book draft or his
00:12:36.079 article or blog or whatever else he
00:12:37.880 wrote If our first writer wants to do
00:12:39.440 the same thing and maybe write a second
00:12:41.279 book well we has to start from scratch
00:12:43.399 he has to go through a long and painful
00:12:44.760 process of finding all this research
00:12:46.800 again it's kind of like how we're taught
00:12:48.240 to do it in school we start with the
00:12:50.040 essay title and then do all the research
00:12:52.399 and once the essay is done we just throw
00:12:53.959 the research away and this system is
00:12:55.920 crazy if you think about it it's
00:12:57.519 inefficient it's slow and if forces you
00:12:59.519 to repeat all the research you want to
00:13:01.279 spend your time writing not finding the
00:13:03.120 same old notes from before with this
00:13:04.880 system you make your notes work for you
00:13:06.800 and not the other way around I'm writing
00:13:08.399 a book now and because it's on a topic I
00:13:10.160 care about a lot of the research already
00:13:12.399 exists in my notetaking software and as
00:13:14.279 I'm writing it up notes I made from
00:13:16.160 months ago will resurface to help me and
00:13:18.399 most of these notes I totally forgot
00:13:20.040 about but because of the links and the
00:13:21.560 tags it allows me to find them when I
00:13:23.320 need them if you invest in this system
00:13:25.040 You're Building yourself a personal
00:13:26.680 writing assistant one that only gets
00:13:28.480 stronger with time I hope I've sold the
00:13:30.199 zetting system well but if you want more
00:13:32.360 details then do check out the book
00:13:34.040 because I've only scratched the surface
00:13:35.760 to be honest so we finally reach the
00:13:37.320 setup stage and I want to show you how
00:13:39.000 you can get the ball running without
00:13:40.279 that usual frustration at the start CU
00:13:42.800 believe me when I was building this for
00:13:44.360 the first time I was pissed off at every
00:13:46.440 corner there was so many things I didn't
00:13:48.480 understand and it was just frustrating I
00:13:50.440 want to also show you how I'd write a
00:13:51.759 note from start to finish using all the
00:13:53.560 different features there's no gimmicks
00:13:55.519 there's no pointless complexity and
00:13:57.240 there's no just simple and
00:13:59.480 effective note taking the first thing to
00:14:01.160 do is install obsidian from their
00:14:02.680 website this is super easy and of course
00:14:04.880 it's totally free you're then given the
00:14:06.440 option to name your Vault but what the
00:14:08.480 hell is a vault anyway this is where all
00:14:10.279 of your notes are stored and it's the
00:14:11.959 highest level of organization in this
00:14:13.759 system when you first make a vault you
00:14:15.480 have to first name it but also choose
00:14:17.480 the location of the Vault this is
00:14:19.120 because a vault is just a folder on your
00:14:20.880 computer and you can choose exactly
00:14:22.600 where that folder goes every note you
00:14:24.399 make an obsidian will become a file in
00:14:26.600 this folder this is great because not
00:14:28.240 only does it let you use obsidian
00:14:29.720 offline but you can also easily copy and
00:14:32.399 transfer your notes because they're just
00:14:34.000 files I would recommend storing your
00:14:35.560 Vault on the cloud somewhere like Google
00:14:38.120 drive or one drive so obviously it's
00:14:40.600 backed up and you can access it from any
00:14:42.920 device mine is in my Google Drive in a
00:14:45.079 folder called obsidian and you might
00:14:46.639 notice that when you do this it creates
00:14:48.680 an extra folder called obsidian this
00:14:51.120 folder holds all of the system files and
00:14:53.399 you don't need to worry about it but
00:14:54.759 it's just good to know where they are
00:14:56.040 and what I love about this system is
00:14:57.399 once you choose the location you you
00:14:59.120 don't really have to worry about it ever
00:15:00.560 again all of the notetaking happens
00:15:02.480 within the app itself now before we dive
00:15:04.320 into the setup with all the folders and
00:15:05.959 stuff I want to let you know that this
00:15:07.560 is going to be a step-by-step approach I
00:15:09.839 may be wrong but I think this is the
00:15:11.279 easiest way for you to understand things
00:15:13.120 instead of you know dumping everything
00:15:14.560 onto you at once this means some things
00:15:16.399 might be confusing in the moment but
00:15:17.920 will'll begin to make sense as we
00:15:19.360 progress through the steps now let's get
00:15:21.040 into the folders I use six in my system
00:15:23.639 but you know to reassure you only three
00:15:25.720 of them are really active in your note
00:15:27.440 taking the other three kind of sit in
00:15:29.000 the background most of the time the
00:15:30.360 folders we're focusing on are the
00:15:31.519 numbered ones so the two at the bottom
00:15:33.519 you can ignore them completely they're
00:15:34.920 just some extra things I use on the side
00:15:36.759 so let's get into the setup and I'll
00:15:38.240 explain each as we go this is what you
00:15:39.880 see when you create a vault I first like
00:15:41.759 to delete all this crap all the tabs and
00:15:43.519 that gives us a clean slate to work from
00:15:45.560 much better next I use this icon on the
00:15:47.600 top left to create six new folders but
00:15:50.040 you know to keep things straightforward
00:15:51.519 let's start with one the first folder I
00:15:53.319 call rough notes Here I jot down
00:15:55.319 anything temporary things like ideas I
00:15:57.720 had maybe reminders
00:15:59.639 or of course rough notes it's like a
00:16:02.120 notepad where you write down things you
00:16:03.600 don't want to forget and anything else
00:16:05.120 you might need for example here I keep
00:16:06.800 up a list of ideas that I might want to
00:16:08.560 research further I also keep a track of
00:16:10.680 my daily word count for my writing habit
00:16:12.920 and to be honest I don't use this folder
00:16:14.440 that much because I prefer to keep all
00:16:16.480 my rough ideas on paper so whether you
00:16:18.480 want to use this folder or not is
00:16:19.759 entirely up to you and your preferences
00:16:21.680 the second folder is called Source
00:16:23.279 material here I store the insights from
00:16:25.399 anything I consume not just books but
00:16:27.600 also videos articles podcasts even
00:16:30.720 Twitter threads anything I like to make
00:16:32.800 different subfolders to store different
00:16:34.600 types of source material but of course
00:16:36.399 this is totally optional and you'll
00:16:37.839 notice that some at the bottom are
00:16:39.120 unsorted and this is on purpose these
00:16:41.040 notes are active meaning I'm still
00:16:42.519 working on them and I haven't finished
00:16:43.759 the writing but of course once I do
00:16:45.440 finish I can then neatly tuck them away
00:16:47.319 where they belong now that's just a
00:16:48.600 setup but don't worry I will dive into
00:16:50.399 these notes a bit later on the third
00:16:51.920 folder stores my tags tags are your best
00:16:54.120 friend in navigating your network
00:16:55.600 especially when it gets large you'll
00:16:57.079 need these if you want to avoid drowning
00:16:58.920 in your notes later on in this folder I
00:17:00.880 store all of the tags and this sounds
00:17:02.959 weird like since when do you store Tags
00:17:05.160 now you can make tags a traditional way
00:17:06.880 using a hashtag and that does work but I
00:17:09.359 prefer a different approach one that I
00:17:10.839 think is more powerful instead each of
00:17:12.839 my tags is just an empty note let's say
00:17:15.199 I'm writing a note about humility and
00:17:16.880 Leadership now of course one of the tags
00:17:19.240 is going to be humility which is a topic
00:17:21.039 I'm interested in to apply the tag to
00:17:22.880 the note I have to make a link to it to
00:17:24.760 do this I type the square bracket button
00:17:26.679 twice and then this brings up a search
00:17:28.559 function from here I type humility and
00:17:30.760 then I close it off with two more square
00:17:32.600 brackets here I've created a link to a
00:17:34.360 note but the reason it's grayed out is
00:17:36.320 because it doesn't exist yet once I
00:17:38.280 click on the link it automatically
00:17:39.640 creates the note and this is the
00:17:41.559 humility tag this is simply a note
00:17:43.400 called humility but we're going to use
00:17:45.039 it as a tag in this case and I don't
00:17:46.679 want it to appear in the same folder as
00:17:48.160 my notes so if you click on the top
00:17:49.840 right it pulls up a drop- down menu and
00:17:51.880 you get the option to take this note and
00:17:53.960 move it to the tags folder so now
00:17:55.960 whenever you write a new note and you
00:17:57.440 want to add the humility tag tag to it
00:17:59.720 all you have to do is use the double
00:18:01.559 square brackets to then link to this
00:18:03.640 note you can create as many tags as you
00:18:05.720 like now I have quite a large list cuz I
00:18:08.240 love to read about lots of different
00:18:09.440 subjects the point of this folder is to
00:18:11.280 keep your system tidy and free from all
00:18:13.240 this clutter if tagging still sounds
00:18:14.960 confusing to you then don't worry cuz
00:18:16.559 we're actually going to revisit it later
00:18:18.120 the fourth folder stores indexes once
00:18:20.320 your knowledge Network grows it can
00:18:22.000 reach a point where it's a bit tricky to
00:18:23.640 navigate and this is what repels most
00:18:25.280 people from starting one they see this
00:18:27.440 horrible ugly spider web looking thing
00:18:29.919 and think how in the hell am I going to
00:18:31.760 navigate this it's just too much and
00:18:33.840 that may be true but luckily we have
00:18:35.480 indexes they come in and solve this
00:18:37.280 problem do you remember the tags from
00:18:38.720 last step well because the tags are just
00:18:40.880 empty notes we can use them as indexes
00:18:42.960 too when a tag gets big enough as in
00:18:45.320 you've connected a lot of notes to it
00:18:47.280 you can actually turn this tag into an
00:18:49.080 index an index is almost like the
00:18:50.960 contents page of a book you take all of
00:18:53.240 the notes within the tag and give them
00:18:55.840 some sort of logical structure and this
00:18:57.480 is super easy because our tags are empty
00:18:59.480 notes and we can just go inside the note
00:19:01.360 and start filling out the index let's
00:19:03.120 take the cility tag again you can see
00:19:05.039 here I have a few notes linking back to
00:19:06.600 this tag now because there's only a few
00:19:08.400 I don't bother making an index there's
00:19:10.159 no point of it cuz I can see everything
00:19:12.360 in one place easily but let's say I
00:19:14.240 choose my learning tag now this is a
00:19:16.240 much bigger one because it has 51
00:19:18.159 relevant notes linking back to it so to
00:19:20.520 turn this tag into an index I add some
00:19:22.360 subheadings and then under these
00:19:24.039 subheadings I link all of the notes that
00:19:26.520 fit that category the idea of the index
00:19:28.760 is to add a basic level of structure to
00:19:30.640 your notes so that if you want to visit
00:19:32.880 the learning topic you have some sort of
00:19:34.679 entry point for the discussion now I
00:19:36.600 have a confession I got a bit lazy and I
00:19:38.440 didn't actually put all of the learning
00:19:39.840 notes in this index but once yours gets
00:19:42.000 big enough do have a go at keeping
00:19:43.559 things neat don't be like me of course
00:19:45.400 if you're just setting up things now you
00:19:47.159 don't have to worry about this stage
00:19:48.840 it's just good to keep in mind for later
00:19:50.679 on when you do have this problem the
00:19:52.400 fifth folder is called the template
00:19:53.880 folder this has one simple job and it
00:19:55.880 stores the template for your main notes
00:19:57.960 once we set this up later you can
00:19:59.320 totally forget about it so don't worry
00:20:01.080 folder number six is the Workhorse of
00:20:03.080 this entire system this is where your
00:20:04.840 main notes go some people call this
00:20:06.679 folder the zetto Casten or Atomic notes
00:20:09.320 the name is up to you the point is this
00:20:10.960 is where every single main note goes in
00:20:13.200 one folder now it sounds weird to put
00:20:15.000 every note in one place but remember
00:20:16.720 from before the lack of folders is what
00:20:19.080 keeps this system flexible and open to
00:20:21.159 connection plus as you add to this
00:20:22.799 folder you will naturally begin to see
00:20:24.559 different areas of Interest form because
00:20:26.240 of the links chaos will slowly turn into
00:20:28.360 a and you'll begin to see patterns in
00:20:30.080 what you're reading I know it's unlike
00:20:31.679 most other systems but if you trust the
00:20:33.400 process it's going to serve you well so
00:20:34.960 there's each folder covered once you set
00:20:36.840 them up with or without the optional
00:20:38.360 ones there's a few important settings we
00:20:40.480 have to jig around with to make the
00:20:42.280 process seamless like butter
00:20:45.799 what butter is not seamless first off we
00:20:48.799 go to files and links in the settings
00:20:51.120 here we'll change the default location
00:20:52.640 for new notes you want to select the one
00:20:54.400 that says in the folder specified below
00:20:56.400 then in the drop- down menu select your
00:20:58.000 main notes folder or whatever else you
00:20:59.760 called it now my notes are kind of ugly
00:21:01.480 but if you want some more aesthetically
00:21:03.039 pleasing ones go to the appearance
00:21:04.960 section in the settings and you know
00:21:06.400 have a play around with the themes next
00:21:08.159 we're going to set up some hotkeys to
00:21:09.360 make your reading as rapid as possible
00:21:11.159 we want to save all of our mental energy
00:21:12.840 for writing not for creating the notes
00:21:15.000 to do this you want to go to the hotkey
00:21:16.760 section of the settings search for
00:21:18.440 template and where it says insert
00:21:20.000 template add any hotkey convenient for
00:21:22.320 you mine is control T which works a
00:21:24.320 charm on Mac this would be command t
00:21:33.720 next go to the core plugin section in
00:21:35.559 the settings these are like extra quirks
00:21:37.400 you can add to obsidian some of these
00:21:38.799 are built into the app but others are
00:21:40.360 made by members of the community in the
00:21:42.159 call plugins you want to turn on the
00:21:43.760 templates now there are a few others you
00:21:45.440 can play around with but for now
00:21:47.039 templates is all we need if you go to
00:21:48.720 the community plug-in section you'll be
00:21:50.200 greeted with this huge list of plugins
00:21:52.200 to try all made by obsidian users you
00:21:54.480 can Overlook all of these for now you
00:21:56.200 don't need any of them but in case
00:21:57.880 you're interested I use two I use one
00:21:59.840 called better word count to upgrade the
00:22:01.760 word count feature but also one called
00:22:03.559 smart random note because sometimes I
00:22:05.279 like to be able to generate a random
00:22:07.240 notes but to clarify this is just my
00:22:09.039 personal preference you don't need them
00:22:10.799 and maybe after you've got into the flow
00:22:12.159 of using this system do have an explore
00:22:14.080 and see if you can upgrade your process
00:22:16.120 somehow but be careful because the power
00:22:18.480 of the system is in its Simplicity if
00:22:20.480 you add endless plugins you might just
00:22:22.320 over complicate the process and distract
00:22:24.400 yourself from the real work so just be
00:22:26.240 wise in what you choose there's a reason
00:22:27.679 that after 9 months mons of use I only
00:22:29.400 have two installed do you remember the
00:22:30.919 templates we messed around with earlier
00:22:32.440 now you'll see how useful they are in
00:22:33.840 action in the settings go to the
00:22:35.440 template section and in the top part
00:22:37.919 select the folder that you created for
00:22:39.440 your templates if you now exit the
00:22:41.200 settings and press contrl t or whichever
00:22:43.960 hotkey you set up for the template it's
00:22:46.120 going to bring up this menu it's empty
00:22:47.840 because we haven't yet created a
00:22:53.120 template this is called a template
00:22:55.159 because with the click of a button you
00:22:56.840 can paste the contents onto empty note
00:22:59.279 and this gives you some basic structure
00:23:01.080 to work with it lives in the templates
00:23:02.679 folder and because of the setting we
00:23:04.240 changed earlier obsidian knows that this
00:23:06.600 is the template you can copy my template
00:23:08.480 for now at the top you can see date and
00:23:10.640 time in between the squiggly brackets
00:23:13.039 now I don't actually know the name of
00:23:14.279 those but the point of them is that once
00:23:15.760 you create a new note the date and time
00:23:17.640 will automatically go there below this
00:23:19.400 is status and tag this is where you add
00:23:21.679 some important information for
00:23:23.080 categorizing the note you'll see this in
00:23:24.520 a bit it's super simple next you have
00:23:26.279 the title of the note and once you type
00:23:28.080 in the title again it's automatically
00:23:30.120 going to be pasted here to make it big
00:23:31.799 and bold like you see here you simply
00:23:33.799 put a hashtag followed by space you can
00:23:36.120 add multiple hashtags to make
00:23:37.360 subheadings and the more hashtags you
00:23:39.000 add the smaller the subheading will be
00:23:40.880 under this you want to leave some blank
00:23:42.080 space so you can actually have room to
00:23:43.400 write your notes then at the bottom make
00:23:45.279 a heading called reference here you're
00:23:47.440 going to link to the source material but
00:23:49.279 also any other similar notes from here
00:23:51.120 the setup is complete so well done I
00:23:53.720 haven't touched these settings since I
00:23:55.360 began this system so thankfully from
00:23:57.440 here it's a low maintenance process now
00:23:59.679 let me walk you through the fun part how
00:24:01.440 you can actually write these notes to
00:24:03.159 create a new note you press crl o now
00:24:05.600 this will bring up a menu and in the
00:24:07.279 search bar you can type in the title of
00:24:09.400 your note and then press shift plus
00:24:11.039 enter to create it the good thing about
00:24:12.760 this menu is that it works as a search
00:24:14.520 bar so if you type in something and you
00:24:16.440 have a similar note already created it's
00:24:18.640 going to pop up for example I might want
00:24:20.240 to create a new note about purpose and
00:24:22.600 when I type in purpose similar notes
00:24:24.880 will come up anything with purpose in
00:24:26.679 the title this helps me avoid writing
00:24:28.640 the same note twice which does happen
00:24:30.760 because you might write a note months in
00:24:32.760 the past and completely forget about it
00:24:34.760 if I have already written the note I can
00:24:36.559 simply jump back into it and maybe
00:24:38.480 elaborate and add something but of
00:24:40.320 course if the note doesn't exist then
00:24:42.520 congratulations you made a new one once
00:24:44.200 you create your new note it's going to
00:24:45.360 be blank and you want your template to
00:24:46.960 be pasted on top of it to do that press
00:24:49.039 contrl T which is the hotkey for your
00:24:50.840 template and then you'll see the one you
00:24:52.840 created pop up press that one and within
00:24:55.240 a second this slaps some structure into
00:24:56.880 your note and it sets you up for right
00:24:58.399 writing without hesitation now for the
00:25:00.279 writing itself you want your notes to be
00:25:02.120 written in a way that serves you the
00:25:03.799 easiest way to show you this is to make
00:25:05.360 a note myself from start to finish
00:25:07.399 recently I read a book called
00:25:08.760 Confessions of a cartel Hitman and yeah
00:25:11.200 it's not the most deep or insightful
00:25:12.760 book but you know I wanted to change the
00:25:14.399 pace I also love to study crime from an
00:25:16.320 anthropology perspective and of course
00:25:18.200 this guy is a cartel member he had
00:25:20.480 firsthand experience which I found
00:25:22.080 interesting I have read this book but
00:25:23.720 now I'm in the notetaking stage where I
00:25:25.679 run through the book again from start to
00:25:27.320 finish and I look for anywhere I took
00:25:29.120 notes I then give these notes a formal
00:25:31.279 write up to solidify them to start off
00:25:33.880 with I make a new note in the source
00:25:35.440 materials folder I give it the title of
00:25:37.360 the book and of course if it was an
00:25:39.120 online Source I would add the link here
00:25:40.799 too this is a book so there's no need
00:25:42.440 for that whenever I encounter a note in
00:25:44.200 the paperback or maybe something I
00:25:45.840 underlined that was interesting I make
00:25:47.840 sure to write the page number down and
00:25:49.720 maybe a relevant quote below this note I
00:25:51.799 then expand on the topic in my own words
00:25:53.960 I talk about my thoughts on it maybe
00:25:55.720 what it reminded me of or even just
00:25:57.520 explain it to myself your in a way that
00:25:58.840 I understand now it's so so important to
00:26:00.919 use your own words here otherwise you
00:26:02.440 risk falling into passive learning of
00:26:04.360 course it's easy to just copy the quote
00:26:05.919 and move on but because this is a quick
00:26:07.799 process you're not really forced to
00:26:09.399 think about it so if you want to
00:26:10.640 remember more and actually understand
00:26:12.039 what you read it's best to take the time
00:26:13.799 to flesh it out as you see it this
00:26:15.960 forces your mind to reflect to think and
00:26:18.159 to truly dwell on the ideas my first
00:26:20.080 note here is about how Martin corono the
00:26:22.039 author felt extreme loyalty to his
00:26:24.159 fellow gang members even early on when
00:26:26.000 he was on the streets I have a page
00:26:27.640 number I have a quote and below it I
00:26:29.840 expanded on the idea I explained how
00:26:31.720 loyalty was the backbone of gang life
00:26:34.200 probably because it feels fulfilling to
00:26:36.440 be part of this close-knit group I carry
00:26:38.679 on through the book repeating this
00:26:39.919 process page number quote elaboration
00:26:43.159 because I write a lot for each one this
00:26:44.600 is a timec consuming process but you
00:26:46.840 know I'm okay with that if it helps the
00:26:48.600 ideas stick I'm willing to make that
00:26:50.200 sacrifice of course you don't have to do
00:26:51.960 the same you can write as little as you
00:26:53.640 want or as much as you want once I
00:26:55.159 finish writing all the source material
00:26:56.760 notes I then create the full notes again
00:26:59.200 I start at the top and I put a new tab
00:27:01.120 to the side by pressing CR o I bring up
00:27:03.360 the search menu I can then type in a new
00:27:05.480 note and create it I then press contrl T
00:27:07.960 which shows me the template and of
00:27:09.520 course I insert that and there you go
00:27:11.080 there's the full note the notes from The
00:27:12.399 Source material were in context but
00:27:14.840 these ones the main notes are not this
00:27:17.279 means they're independent from The
00:27:18.480 Source material and they're
00:27:19.600 self-explanatory because of that one
00:27:21.279 simple change it almost standardizes
00:27:23.559 them and it lets them connect to other
00:27:25.279 notes freely it also gives you a chance
00:27:27.039 to talk about the bigger picture once
00:27:28.799 you write the notes in the source
00:27:30.000 material you can then ask yourself so
00:27:32.399 what why does this matter what does this
00:27:34.480 mean so throughout the source note I
00:27:36.159 might see the same idea pop up again and
00:27:37.919 again and to me that's something worth
00:27:39.760 talking about the main note gives me a
00:27:41.360 chance to take all of that and wrap it
00:27:42.919 up as a key idea or a key takeaway I
00:27:45.480 explained this process a little bit more
00:27:46.799 in a past video so I'll try and remember
00:27:48.519 to link that here for example this note
00:27:50.200 I've created says that criminal gangs
00:27:52.000 are united by a deep sense of loyalty
00:27:54.039 and belonging now this makes no mention
00:27:55.799 of Martin Corona the cartel member but
00:27:58.399 what it does mention is the bigger
00:27:59.880 picture the thing I want to walk away
00:28:01.720 with of course you can reference people
00:28:03.320 or events directly from the book But be
00:28:05.360 sure to explain it you want to be able
00:28:07.240 to return to these notes and actually
00:28:09.159 understand what's going on immediately
00:28:10.640 let's now go through the notes from top
00:28:12.120 to bottom the status tag is not that
00:28:14.360 important and honestly you can do
00:28:15.840 without it I will use it for two things
00:28:18.279 first I'll will either write # bab #
00:28:21.360 child or # adult this sounds weird but
00:28:23.960 all it means is how develop the note is
00:28:26.039 if the note is new it's badly written
00:28:27.880 and maybe unconnected or write # bab
00:28:30.640 which tells me it's kind of in its young
00:28:32.320 stage once I write more edit the notes
00:28:34.320 and connect it to other things I can
00:28:36.200 upgrade that status to a child and then
00:28:38.039 adult all this does is help me know
00:28:39.679 which notes maybe need more attention
00:28:41.320 and more work again this is a less
00:28:43.120 important feature so please feel free to
00:28:45.240 remove it from your template if the note
00:28:46.919 contains a quote I also like to put #t
00:28:49.240 quote in this section I love to use
00:28:51.120 quotes in my writing because I feel like
00:28:52.760 it's a a Punchy way to get your message
00:28:54.600 forward so by putting #t quote it just
00:28:56.760 lets me find them more easily next comes
00:28:58.559 the tag section now we've already talked
00:29:00.279 about how to make tags but I must
00:29:02.880 confess this part can be tricky for
00:29:04.440 months I looked for advice on how to tag
00:29:06.240 my notes properly how specific should I
00:29:07.919 be how many tags should I add should I
00:29:09.960 do it according to my interests or the
00:29:11.840 subject I had all these unanswered
00:29:13.640 questions and I was lost for Direction I
00:29:15.320 want you to avoid the same Rabbit Hole
00:29:16.919 so here are some pointers for Effective
00:29:18.519 tagging ones that I learned the hard way
00:29:20.399 first try to avoid tags that are too
00:29:22.240 vague now for example I'm technically
00:29:25.000 into self-improvement but what does that
00:29:27.320 even mean it's such a vague idea that
00:29:30.039 could mean Fitness it could mean Health
00:29:32.919 it could mean business it could mean
00:29:34.519 religion it could mean all sorts of
00:29:36.200 different things if I showed you a note
00:29:37.960 that said self-improvement you can't
00:29:39.640 really guess what's inside of course you
00:29:41.279 don't want it to be too precise either
00:29:42.799 otherwise you'll end up never using it
00:29:44.320 again you want it to be somewhere in the
00:29:45.600 middle when I feel the need to create a
00:29:47.279 new tag I ask myself a simple question
00:29:50.120 will I ever use this tag again is there
00:29:51.960 anything I might come across that will
00:29:53.399 also have this tag another tip that
00:29:55.120 saved me so much irritation in tagging
00:29:57.360 is to keep tag tags related to your
00:29:59.039 interests rather than what other people
00:30:01.039 think is a common category the most
00:30:02.880 obvious tags will be things like Fitness
00:30:05.360 sociology maths things like that now
00:30:08.039 those make sense in The Wider world but
00:30:09.760 this is your system so the tag should
00:30:11.600 serve you above all for example I have a
00:30:13.679 tag called dangers to male female
00:30:15.760 relationships now this sounds quite
00:30:17.480 weird it's not a category of content you
00:30:19.360 hear about every day it may be a bit
00:30:21.039 Niche and precise but it works for me
00:30:23.159 because it's something I'm interested in
00:30:24.559 I know for a fact that I'm going to
00:30:25.720 encounter more ideas that's going to be
00:30:27.600 relevant to this topic and this means
00:30:29.279 that the tags are serving my interests
00:30:31.200 and not necessarily what the rest of the
00:30:32.559 world is thinking remember this system
00:30:34.279 is your second brain it doesn't belong
00:30:36.159 to anyone else and that means the tag
00:30:38.000 should serve you and you alone in the
00:30:39.720 early stage of the system you're going
00:30:41.200 to find yourself creating loads of new
00:30:42.880 tags but remember after creating one and
00:30:44.760 moving it to your tag section you can
00:30:46.640 infinitely reuse it as you progress and
00:30:49.080 you've covered most of your interests
00:30:50.679 things will calm down a little for this
00:30:52.159 note I know I don't have to create many
00:30:53.840 new tags I've already talked about ideas
00:30:55.880 similar to this and the tags will
00:30:57.639 already exist so I apply the Loyalty tag
00:31:00.039 I apply the meaning tag and this is a
00:31:02.080 good start but I see something's missing
00:31:04.360 I haven't accounted for the criminal
00:31:05.760 side of this tag now I love to read
00:31:07.320 about cartel history and maybe
00:31:09.000 criminology in general I know I'm going
00:31:10.799 to encounter this idea again so it makes
00:31:12.519 sense to create a new tag for it so
00:31:14.200 maybe I'll create a new tag called
00:31:16.039 cartels or criminal life something not
00:31:18.840 too vague but not too specific another
00:31:20.880 common problem I have is that sometimes
00:31:22.440 I forget tags exist and I forget to use
00:31:24.760 them where they should be used now it's
00:31:26.399 a real pain in the ass but I found a
00:31:27.960 work around what I do is I search for
00:31:29.440 similar notes using the hyperlink
00:31:31.240 function and then I go into those notes
00:31:33.360 and see what they have tagged and
00:31:35.120 sometimes this reminds me of tag that I
00:31:36.440 forgot about and I can just reuse it in
00:31:37.960 my new notes the final nugget of tag
00:31:39.919 advice is to not put too many down you
00:31:42.480 can add 6 Seven 8 but at that point it
00:31:44.880 starts to get confusing and messy I aim
00:31:46.760 to keep it below four and five most of
00:31:48.320 the time and you can't even go wrong
00:31:49.799 with just one tag Now we move to the
00:31:51.240 bulk of the note itself there's not much
00:31:52.760 to say here it's as simple as discussing
00:31:54.760 idea in order to better understand it
00:31:56.399 yourself it's an outlook for reflection
00:31:58.320 almost because I've already written a
00:31:59.919 lot in the source material note I tend
00:32:01.480 to just copy paste it sometimes I then
00:32:03.720 maybe expand upon it edit the structure
00:32:06.080 improve upon it and do all these things
00:32:08.159 to make it as useful as possible for me
00:32:10.159 or I can start from scratch and use the
00:32:11.919 source material notes as inspiration
00:32:14.080 most people write Less in the source
00:32:15.639 materials and then use this step for the
00:32:17.399 full write up so really it depends on
00:32:19.480 what you prefer I just like to write a
00:32:20.960 lot because as I said it helps slow down
00:32:22.799 the flow and helps you remember it
00:32:24.320 better the format of these notes is also
00:32:26.120 your call I love to write these notes as
00:32:27.880 mini essays which I talk about in an
00:32:29.480 earlier video so do check that out but
00:32:31.760 of course if you feel like a single
00:32:33.559 sentence is enough to capture the idea
00:32:35.480 go for it you can use blunt informative
00:32:37.720 sentences you can use a story to tell
00:32:40.240 something you can use a personal
00:32:41.760 experience to make light of what you
00:32:43.159 read literally anything goes because
00:32:45.039 remember these are your notes and you
00:32:46.480 can do whatever you please I'm not going
00:32:47.960 to be assessing them like a teacher and
00:32:49.480 neither will anyone else and speaking of
00:32:51.159 mini essays you're going to see some in
00:32:52.399 my newsletter so do be sure to subscribe
00:32:54.600 with the link in the description it's
00:32:56.200 totally free of course with that said I
00:32:58.039 do have two small tips that help me keep
00:32:59.679 my notes focused and free from clutter
00:33:02.360 first I recommend that you keep these
00:33:03.600 notes quite short so that you avoid
00:33:05.399 turning them into this full-blown
00:33:06.919 article or essay you want to use these
00:33:08.679 notes as tools for learning or maybe to
00:33:10.600 write up something you don't really want
00:33:12.159 the note to be the large writing project
00:33:14.120 itself this defeats the whole purpose of
00:33:15.679 the note because it's no longer
00:33:16.880 versatile I recommend keeping them below
00:33:18.960 500 Words And as a rule of thumb I try
00:33:21.080 and write so that everything fits on the
00:33:22.960 page without having to scroll down it
00:33:25.039 just keeps things focused and concise
00:33:27.000 the second tip is so important and it's
00:33:28.679 to keep each mini essay focused on a
00:33:30.880 single idea again you want your notes to
00:33:32.679 be as clear and as flexible as possible
00:33:35.039 you want to be able to use them in all
00:33:36.360 sorts of situations whether that's
00:33:38.080 writing something or maybe just to
00:33:40.000 refresh your memory if you create a
00:33:41.600 complicated note that pulls together
00:33:43.159 many different ideas you end up with
00:33:45.039 this messy jumble and because it's short
00:33:47.000 you don't really have the time to flesh
00:33:48.399 them out it may feel insightful but you
00:33:50.240 may just be diluting the message and
00:33:52.000 making it hard to understand what the
00:33:53.720 note is about now connections are great
00:33:55.480 don't get me wrong it's great to mix and
00:33:56.960 match ideas but you should save this
00:33:59.000 probably for a larger piece of writing
00:34:00.919 maybe a full-blown essay there you have
00:34:02.639 the room to expand upon these ideas and
00:34:04.480 to really flesh them out and give them
00:34:05.840 the attention they deserve if you want
00:34:07.399 to expand on a note in obsidian simply
00:34:09.480 make a new one and then write about the
00:34:11.440 next idea there and maybe connect it
00:34:13.399 back using a link it's the same end
00:34:15.239 result but by doing so you've kept your
00:34:16.800 notes clear and flexible also here's an
00:34:18.839 underrated piece of advice format your
00:34:21.079 notes so that they're easier to read
00:34:23.079 trust me your future self doesn't want
00:34:24.599 to revisit these notes and be met with
00:34:26.239 this big fat ugly block of text text so
00:34:28.599 try and include spaces between the lines
00:34:30.879 at natural break points this keeps it
00:34:32.639 easy to read and it takes less mental
00:34:34.399 energy and that leads us to the final
00:34:36.119 stage at last referencing at the bottom
00:34:38.560 of the notes in the references section I
00:34:40.359 create hyperlinks to any notes that
00:34:42.159 discuss similar ideas I also like to
00:34:44.079 link to the source material that the
00:34:45.560 idea came from in this case it would be
00:34:47.359 Confessions of a cartel Hitman the book
00:34:49.320 in The Source materials folder again
00:34:51.119 this is easy to do it's the same
00:34:52.719 function as tagging you press the square
00:34:54.480 bracket button twice and then search for
00:34:56.159 any notes that connect and then you just
00:34:57.960 press enter the same problem happens
00:34:59.640 with tagging though you might forget
00:35:01.079 about notes and forget to tag them the
00:35:02.960 easiest way to get around this is to
00:35:04.280 look up keywords and because those
00:35:06.640 keywords probably exist in the title of
00:35:09.240 the notes you might end up stumbling
00:35:11.200 upon ones that are relevant to be extra
00:35:13.040 sure I'm not missing anything I might
00:35:14.560 even go to the tags of the note and at
00:35:16.480 the bottom of the tag you see all of the
00:35:18.560 linked notes and chances are something
00:35:20.920 in there might be relevant enough to
00:35:22.839 connect and finally at the bottom I link
00:35:24.520 to the source material this is just a
00:35:26.400 handy way to know exactly where the idea
00:35:29.160 came from and if you ever want to
00:35:30.359 revisit the source you know where to
00:35:31.960 find it without tagging The Source note
00:35:33.560 you might have to end up scaring the
00:35:35.040 internet to find where it came from and
00:35:36.640 of course you don't want to be in that
00:35:37.680 situation I think that's everything
00:35:39.640 that's a long video so thank you for
00:35:40.920 watching and the thing is with these
00:35:42.880 setups is you can't mention everything I
00:35:45.960 I know for a fact that I've missed some
00:35:47.920 points here and I've missed some details
00:35:49.680 and there will be questions so of course
00:35:52.920 the comments are open my email is open
00:35:55.640 feel free to shoot me anything that you
00:35:57.440 don't understand and I'm I'll gladly
00:35:59.000 explain it because this is hard and it
00:36:01.960 might take a a few days few weeks few
00:36:04.160 months to get into the flow of things
00:36:05.960 but trust me if you persevere through
00:36:07.839 that you will understand you'll get a
00:36:09.880 feel for how the app works and overall
00:36:11.960 it will start to work for you so I
00:36:13.280 really hope that I've covered everything
00:36:15.359 well enough to get going but again feel
00:36:18.079 free to ask questions feel free to check
00:36:20.640 the comments for any answers you might
00:36:22.800 have and of course thank you so much for
