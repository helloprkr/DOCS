`Y <chain_of_thought> I will analyze how to effectively use the Zettelkasten method for scientific research, particularly focusing on incorporating data analysis and experimental results. I'll break this down using first principles, analyze the current situation, formulate a strategy, and provide recommendations for optimizing the use of Zettelkasten in scientific fields. </chain_of_thought> 1. First-Principles Analysis <chain_of_thought> Breaking down the Zettelkasten method and scientific research into fundamental components: 1. Knowledge capture 2. Idea connection 3. Information retrieval 4. Insight generation 5. Data collection 6. Data analysis 7. Experimental design 8. Result interpretation 9. Paper writing </chain_of_thought> 2. Current Situation Analysis <chain_of_thought> Analyzing the current use of Zettelkasten in scientific research based on the search results: </chain_of_thought> Zettelkasten is primarily associated with humanities and social sciences, but it can be adapted for STEM fields[2]. Some researchers have successfully implemented Zettelkasten-like systems in technical disciplines, splitting notes by nature (literature notes, lexicon, memos, quotes, and original ideas)[2]. However, there are challenges in incorporating experimental results and data analysis into the traditional Zettelkasten framework[7]. 3. Desired Outcome Definition <chain_of_thought> The desired outcome is to effectively integrate the Zettelkasten method into scientific research processes, allowing researchers to: </chain_of_thought> - Capture and organize knowledge from literature and experimental results - Generate new insights by connecting ideas across different experiments and sources - Efficiently retrieve information for paper writing and grant proposals - Track the development of ideas and hypotheses throughout the research process 4. Strategy Formulation <chain_of_thought> Developing a strategy to adapt Zettelkasten for scientific research: </chain_of_thought> 1. Create a hybrid system that combines traditional Zettelkasten with a lab notebook approach[2][4]. 2. Use Zettelkasten for literature notes, concept development, and hypothesis generation[5]. 3. Implement a separate but linked system for experimental data, code, and analysis results[7]. 4. Develop a consistent linking system between conceptual notes and experimental data[5]. 5. Use the Zettelkasten to capture insights and questions arising from data analysis[4]. 5. Success Probability Estimation <chain_of_thought> Estimating the success probability of this strategy: </chain_of_thought> - Literature integration: 90% (well-established Zettelkasten use) - Concept development: 85% (proven in various fields) - Experimental data linking: 70% (requires careful implementation) - Insight generation: 80% (depends on researcher's engagement) - Overall success probability: 81% The overall success probability is high due to the flexibility of the Zettelkasten method and its proven track record in knowledge management. The main challenge lies in effectively linking experimental data and analysis results. 6. Reverse-Engineered Strategy Breakdown <chain_of_thought> Breaking down the strategy into key components: </chain_of_thought> 1. Set up a digital Zettelkasten system (e.g., Obsidian, Roam Research) 2. Create a parallel system for lab notebooks and data storage 3. Develop a consistent tagging and linking system 4. Implement a routine for processing literature and experimental results 5. Regularly review and connect notes to generate insights 6. Use the system for outlining papers and grant proposals 7. Optimization Opportunities <chain_of_thought> Identifying ways to optimize the strategy: </chain_of_thought> 1. Automate the creation of links between experimental data and conceptual notes 2. Implement a visualization tool to map connections between ideas and data 3. Use machine learning to suggest relevant connections and potential research directions 4. Develop templates for different types of notes (literature, experimental, conceptual) 5. Create a collaborative Zettelkasten system for research teams 8.A Final Recommendations <chain_of_thought> Providing actionable recommendations for implementing the strategy: </chain_of_thought> 1. Start by creating a digital Zettelkasten using a tool like Obsidian or Roam Research. 2. Develop a consistent note-taking structure for literature reviews, experimental designs, and data analysis insights[2]. 3. Use unique identifiers for each note, allowing for easy cross-referencing between conceptual ideas and experimental results[5]. 4. Implement a daily routine of capturing thoughts, questions, and insights from both literature and experiments[4]. 5. Create a separate but linked system for raw data, code, and detailed experimental procedures[7]. 6. Regularly review and connect notes, focusing on generating new hypotheses and research directions. 7. Use the Zettelkasten to outline papers and grant proposals, drawing on the interconnected network of ideas and results[4]. 8. Continuously refine the system based on personal workflow and research needs. By implementing these recommendations, researchers can leverage the power of the Zettelkasten method to enhance their scientific work, from literature review to experimental design and paper writing. This adapted approach allows for the incorporation of data-driven insights while maintaining the benefits of idea connection and knowledge management inherent to the Zettelkasten method.

Show transcript Odysseas 164K subscribers Videos About Twitter Transcript Search in video Intro 0:00 - Almost a year ago I started building this. You can call it a personal network of knowledge, 0:05 but you might know it as a "Zettelkasten", or a "second brain". After years of searching for the perfect approach to my learning, 0:11 I think this is it. By far it's been the most valuable asset for reading, for writing and, even for my thinking, Avoiding Toxic Perfectionism 0:17 but before I hype it up to you, and show you how to make your own, there's something I should warn you about... A hidden danger. 0:22 It's one that left me incredibly frustrated when I first started to make my own. It was a pain in the ass to get started. 0:28 And I mean that. If you look up "how to create a Zettelkasten in Obsidian". Or "how to build a second brain", 0:34 you'll find probably hundreds of videos with each person showing their own method and their own way of doing it. And don't get me wrong, 0:39 some of these were great, like, I used them to build my own, and I couldn't be here without them. But the problem is, as I kept watching more and more videos, 0:46 I was digging myself a trap. One that would be harder and harder to eventually climb out of when I had to. 0:52 Every single YouTuber I watched had their own method of creating it. One that was slightly different to the next. And if you end up watching 10 or 20 of these, 1:00 you start to pick out points from every single one, and then it fills you with this almost toxic sense of perfectionism. 1:06 For example, I'd find some nice features from one video, and then watch another video, and they have something different that stands out to me, 1:12 like a shiny gem. I take that, and then that process repeats. And if you combine all their points from all these videos, 1:18 you end up with this mess. This Frankenstein's monster of a setup that tries to be everything, but fails. 1:24 I was deluded in doing that. I thought I could steal from everyone else's workflow and make the perfect one, 1:29 but that's not how it works. In fact, all it did was bug me down. For months I didn't really do much writing. 1:34 I was just obsessed with getting the "perfect setup", which doesn't exist anyway. But thankfully I eventually realized that 1:40 this system was never going to be perfect. In fact every time I added a new feature, I was only adding a pointless gimmick 1:47 that was a distraction from the true work, the writing. And without wasting more time, I just gripped my teeth 1:52 and moved forward with what I had already. I abandoned all the weird gimmicks, the plugins... All the bullshit features that didn't actually matter. 1:59 And I focused on the bare bones. And suddenly a weight was just lifted off my shoulders. It felt good because now I can actually do what I wanted to do, 2:06 which was to write. I didn't have to worry on finding the perfect system and optimizing every single step of the way. 2:11 I do realize now I'm just an extra voice in the conversation, but I just want to reassure you and say that this setup is free from bullshit. 2:18 There are no pointless features, there are no gimmicks. This setup is simple. It's minimalistic. My Testimony 2:24 It focuses only on the key features that actually help you get to where you want to be. And I have the experience to vouch for this system. 2:30 I've used Obsidian for, I think 9 months now, almost every day. And since the start after hundreds of notes, 2:37 it hasn't changed. The setup is exactly the same, and, to me, that's solid evidence that it works. 2:43 So if you're feeling intimidated by the idea of starting your own, I get you, I was in that same position, but I hope this setup can free you of some of that stress 2:49 and really give you the building blocks you need to just get started. If you want an immediate walkthrough on how to set it up, then please do skip to that, The Zettelkasten 2:55 but for this next portion of the video, I want to talk about why should you do do this anyway. Like what's in it for you. 3:01 It seems like a lot of effort, and it is, but I want to cover three main benefits that make it so powerful as a learning tool. 3:07 Over the years I've tried many learning techniques, cuz I was sick and tired of walking away from my books. The same person forgetting all the important things 3:14 and failing to reflect on what was inside. It was exhausting. And I felt like all the efforts I put into the learning 3:19 was just vanishing into thin air. And it was all for nothing. This all changed when I read a book called "How to Take Smart Notes", by Sönke Ahrens. 3:27 Now I think that's how you pronounce it, but do correct me for German. This is the book I chose to bring on a 3-hour flight 3:32 and I thought it would just be a casual laid-back experience on, you know, maybe how you can make your notes a little bit more effective. 3:38 I was so, so wrong. By the time the plane landed, the course of my entire reading from that point would change forever. 3:44 Those 3 hours I was just captivated by what I was reading, cuz this was revolutionary. I had never thought of note taking learning quite like this. 3:52 This book tore down lots of misconceptions I got from traditional education and it gave me this fresh and exciting perspective to reading. 3:58 It was the idea of as Zettelkasten. A slip-box, which is exactly what we're building today. Now I do recommend you check his book out, 4:04 cuz it is really good. But, to keep it brief, the Zettelkasten is a note taking system that builds your notes from the bottom up. 4:11 It let you take the ideas you read and embed it in this network of knowledge. One that serves you in all your goals, 4:16 from learning, to reading, to writing. There's three main ways it's so effective, and almost unlike any other note taking system. The Value of Being Slow 4:23 The first reason is that it forces you to slow down. Now, a lot of people don't like to hear that, all the hustle grinds bros, 4:29 they don't like the idea of abandoning speed reading. And they might hate me for saying this, but it's true! In most cases, 4:35 speed and reading are not a good mix. The best thing I ever did for my reading was to slow it right down, 4:40 and take thorough notes in the process. The slowness of the writing forces you to dwell on the author's ideas. Of course it's slower, you do lose speed, 4:47 but, to me, that's a worthy sacrifice, because all the ideas will have a lasting impact on your mind. It's like when you eat too much at Christmas 4:53 and you sit there all stuffed and bloated, and you have to really wait and digest to be able to come to life again. 5:00 This is kind of the same thing, but with your brain. The result is not only a way better attention of what you read, but you also start to understand things more deeply, 5:07 because, you know, some of these books are chunky. And it's not like you can speed through them and just remember everything. The second power of the Zettelkasten Instant Feedback 5:14 is that it gives you instant feedback on your learning. I'm not sure how it works in the USA, but in the UK we have this thing called A levels, 5:21 and that's 2 years of study before going to University. And you can pick three or four subjects for that, and I did History. 5:26 And in History there was a lot of essay writing. We did essays almost every week. Now, normally, you hand in your essay 5:32 and you get feedback a week later, but let's say there was a twist this time. Every time I handed this essay in, 5:37 I would never get any feedback. If that pattern continued for a year or two, I would get to the end of my A levels 5:43 and my essay writing would be just as shit as when I first started, because to get better at any skill, you need two things: 5:48 You need practice and you need feedback. Now, in that case, I had lots of practice. I wrote every week, no problem there. 5:54 But I didn't get any feedback. And if there's no one there to correct you, you're going to end up making the same stupid mistakes 5:59 again, and again, and again. Writing notes is the exact opposite of that situation, because by doing that we get instant feedback. 6:05 By writing, we get an instant reflection of our own understanding, because if we struggle to put something into words, 6:11 then that's a sign that we haven't understood it. It's a sign for you to go back to the book and check your understanding. 6:16 This is a prime example of the fame and technique in action, which says that, if you teach something, in this case writing, 6:22 you actually learn it better yourself. The third benefit of this system is that you allow your notes to form connections. Perfect Idea Storage 6:28 Most people store their notes by subject. In these clear subdivided folders. Now this makes sense in our head. 6:33 We've been taught to do it in school, but there's actually hidden danger to it, because it has a tendency to isolate your ideas 6:39 and that stops you from seeing the bigger picture. You'll see what I mean with the example, and it's going to sound really weird at first, but bear with me. 6:45 Why are reptiles mostly in hotter areas of the world? It's because they're ectotherms, which you probably know as "cold blooded". 6:51 Now this means that, to effectively hunt and escape predators, they have to warm up using the environment. Like, when a lizard sits on a rock to absorb the energy of the sun. 6:59 Because we're mammals we can produce our own heat from within, but this is expensive, because, unlike lizards, we have to eat a lot more to keep ourselves warm. 7:07 Well, the hidden strength that we have, as mammals, is that we can stay active even in the cold. If you travel North to the Arctic, as a lizard, 7:14 it's going to be so cold that you can't properly move, and you end up either starving or dying to a predator, 7:20 but since we produce our own heat, we can stay active, and that means we can avoid predators and also hunt effectively. 7:26 We can out compete the reptiles even in the coldest temperatures. Okay that's that, but let's slow down a second. 7:32 Why am I giving you a biology lesson? I gave you a simple explanation of that topic, but if you want to understand it in depth, 7:38 you have to know things from chemistry, from physics, from biology, from ecology. To understand the bigger picture. 7:43 You have to pull ideas from all four of these subjects, and if you fail to understand something in that chain of reasoning, 7:49 you might not get the whole thing. In that same example, if you have no idea why muscles slow down when they're cold, 7:54 then you won't be able to explain that properly to me. But there is hope, because if you understand the physics, and the chemistry, and the biology, 8:01 you can somehow piece everything together into this clear picture. And you can understand it and you can explain it to me. 8:07 This is true wisdom. This is the end result of learning, the most valuable thing you can achieve. And this system, this Zettelkasten, 8:13 is exactly how you'll get there. The second major benefit of the Zettelkasten is how it helps you store and mix ideas. 8:20 Before I started taking notes like this, I would write all of the things I learned in separate notebooks. I love the feeling of pen on paper 8:26 because you can be free with it and you can draw all the diagrams you want. It's satisfying. Now this was all well and good, 8:31 but as there was a few notebooks in, I started to realize a problem that was creeping up on me. How the hell am I going to manage this later? 8:38 Am I going to end up with 100 notebooks? Like, what do I do then? So I made the painful decision to overhaul everything 8:44 and prevent this disaster. It may have hurt in the moment, but I knew that this physical method of notetaking was going to hurt me in the future. 8:51 And it had its limits. With Obsidian, the app we're using today, all of your notes are in the same place, 8:57 whenever and wherever you need them. Instead of of carrying 100 notebooks or flash cards, you have your whole personal library 9:03 on your phone or computer. And if you store your note files on the cloud, you can literally travel across half the world 9:09 and you'll still be able to find them. Even though I love taking notes on paper, this is the obvious best choice nowadays. The Power to Remix Ideas 9:14 So, the storage of notes is already perfect, but there's an extra benefit of having everything in one place. It's the power of connecting ideas to make new ones. 9:22 In this system, like we said before, your notes are free from the restrictions of folders. This means you don't have to go through 9:27 the annoying process of opening 10 different subfolders to find that exact note you were looking for. 9:33 In this system they're all in one arena, they're all free to mingle and to connect. Insights from Socrates, Dante and the Bible 9:39 can connect with those from... Maybe Virginia Woolf or Nietzsche, or any other modern author you can think of every. Every new book, video and article you read 9:47 can add something valuable to the conversation. Something that can form these exciting connections that you never saw coming. 9:52 Your network of notes only get stronger with time. And you can't say the same for a system of folders, because the more you add, 9:58 the more messy and confusing it gets. This is the exact opposite. And I know what you might be thinking: This looks chaotic. 10:04 It looks messy. It's ugly. And I will admit, mine is uglier than most people's online. 10:09 Without a system of tags and hyperlinks, it is a mess and it is hard to navigate. But if you follow some basic rules 10:14 in how you construct the notes and organize it, it's actually really easy to then navigate this maze 10:19 and find exactly what you're looking for. And I'm not giving it enough credit here, because sometimes you'll write a note, and then months down the line you completely forget it exists. Your Personal Writing Assistant 10:28 But because of your system of links, you end up rediscovering it by accident and it's the nicest surprise. 10:33 And here's the nice part: If you're more of an organized type of person, which you know I am too, I like folders, 10:39 this system still caters to you. If you use tags, you can add this extra layer of organization to your notes 10:44 and if you want to find something related to a specific topic, it's still easy. And if it sounds confusing, no worries, 10:49 because we're going to walk through these steps in detail a bit later on. The third major benefit is easier and faster writing. 10:55 And this is by far my favorite one. It's so exciting to talk about. When I first read about this idea in how to take smart notes, 11:00 I swear I almost got goosebumps, because, at the time, I knew this was big, this would change how I write forever. 11:07 The best way to show you this is to compare two different writers. Our first writer has an idea for a book, and, you know, he's got a rough idea of the structure, 11:14 so all he has to do now is set out to research. Whenever he finds a useful idea, he just takes it and puts it in his planning draft. 11:20 He then uses subheadings to sort it out and see what will go where. After many long hours, lots of caffeine, 11:26 and maybe an existential crisis, or two, he's finished the book. That sounds all good, right? 11:31 Well, yeah, maybe for now, but you'll see he's screwing himself over in the future. Our second writer also wants to write a book, 11:37 but he starts without an idea for the title. He doesn't know what the end product might be, instead he just reads about whatever he's interested in 11:44 and on the way, he picks up the ideas that resonate the most. With some simple organization of his notes, he begins to see these areas of interest form around certain topics. 11:52 In the case of Obsidian, this can be literal clusters that begin to form. For example, the more he reads about human behavior, 11:58 the bigger the area of this discussion gets, and before he knows it, he's got the building blocks for a book. With a quick look through the notes, 12:03 the writer sees how he can order them in a linear way. Now, all it takes is some rearranging, some editing and, 12:09 of course, a little bit of extra writing. But then, suddenly, you have a book. It was a relatively quick process, 12:14 because most of the writing was already done in the form of the notes, way before the idea of the book even existed. 12:20 The first writer didn't have this opportunity, and he's also missing out on a second benefit, because the second writer collected his ideas 12:26 outside of the book draft, he can reuse these notes as as many times as he wants in all sorts of different projects. 12:31 In other words, none of his research is stuck within the book draft, or his article, or blog, or whatever else he wrote. 12:38 If our first writer wants to do the same thing and maybe write a second book... Well, he has to start from scratch. He has to go through a long and painful process 12:45 of finding all this research again. It's kind of like, how we're taught to do it in school. We start with the essay title and then do all the research. 12:52 And once the essay is done, we just throw the research away. And this system is crazy if you think about it. It's inefficient, 12:58 it's slow, and if forces you to repeat all the research. You want to spend your time writing, not finding the same old notes from before. 13:04 With this system you make your notes work for you and not the other way around. I'm writing a book now and because it's on a topic I care about, 13:11 a lot of the research already exists in my notetaking software, and as I'm writing it up, notes I made from months ago will resurface to help me. 13:18 And most of these notes I totally forgot about, but because of the links and the tags, it allows me to find them when I need them. 13:23 If you invest in this system, you're building yourself a personal writing assistant, one that only gets stronger with time. 13:29 I hope I've sold the Zettelkasten system well, but if you want more details, then do check out the book, because I've only scratched the surface, to be honest. 13:36 So, we finally reach the setup stage and I want to show you how you can get the ball running without that usual frustration at the start, 13:42 cuz believe me: When I was building this for the first time, I was pissed off at every corner. There was so many things I didn't understand, 13:48 and it was just frustrating. I want to also show you how I'd write a note from start to finish, using all the different features. 13:54 There's no gimmicks, there's no pointless complexity, and there's no bullshit. Just simple and effective note taking. Folder Setup + How to Tag 14:00 The first thing to do is install Obsidian from the website. This is super easy, and of course, it's totally free. 14:05 You're then given the option to name your vault, but what the hell is a vault anyway? This is where all of your notes are stored, 14:11 and it's the highest level of organization in this system. When you first make a vault, you have to first name it, 14:16 but also choose the location of the vault. This is because a vault is just a folder on your computer, and you can choose exactly where that folder goes. 14:23 Every note you make on Obsidian will become a file in this folder. This is great, because not only does it let you use Obsidian offline, 14:30 but you can also easily copy and transfer your notes, because they're just files. I would recommend storing your vault on the cloud, 14:37 somewhere like Google Drive, or OneDrive. So, obviously, it's backed up and you can access it from any device. 14:43 Mine is in my Google Drive, in a folder called Obsidian, and you might notice that when you do this, it creates an extra folder called ".obsidian". 14:51 This folder holds all of the system files, and you don't need to worry about it, but it's just good to know where they are. 14:56 And what I love about the system is, once you choose the location, you don't really have to worry about it ever again. 15:01 All of the notetaking happens within the app itself. Now, before we dive into the setup with all the folders and stuff, 15:06 I want to let you know that this is going to be a step-by-step approach. I may be wrong, but I think this is the easiest way for you 15:12 to understand things instead of, you know, dumping everything onto you at once. This means some things might be confusing in the moment, 15:17 but we'll begin to make sense as we progress through the steps. Now, let's get into the folders: I use six in my system, 15:23 but, you know, to reassure you, only three of them are really active in your note taking. The other three kind of sit in the background most of the time. 15:30 The folders we're focusing on are the numbered ones, so the two at the bottom, you can ignore them completely. They're just some extra things I use on the side. 15:36 So let's get into the setup and I'll explain each as we go. This is what you see when you create a vault. I first like to delete all this crap, all the tabs. 15:43 And that gives us a clean slate to work from. Much better. Next, I use this icon on the top left to create six new folders, 15:49 but, you know, to keep things straightforward, let's start with One. The first folder I call "Rough Notes". Here I jot down anything temporary. 15:56 Things like ideas I had, maybe reminders, or, of course, rough notes. 16:01 It's like a notepad where you write down things you don't want to forget. And anything else you might need. For example, here I keep up a list of ideas 16:07 that I might want to research further. I also keep a track of my daily word count for my writing habit. 16:12 And, to be honest, I don't use this folder that much, because I prefer to keep all my rough ideas on paper, 16:18 so whether you want to use this folder or not is entirely up to you and your preferences. The second folder is called "Source Material". 16:23 Here I store the insights from anything I consume. Not just books, but also videos, articles, podcasts... 16:30 Even Twitter threads. Anything. I like to make different subfolders to store different types of source material. 16:36 But, of course, this is totally optional, and you'll notice that some at the bottom are unsorted. And this is on purpose. These notes are active, 16:41 meaning I'm still working on them and I haven't finished the writing, but of course, once I do finish, I can then neatly tuck them away where they belong. 16:48 Now that's just a setup, but don't worry, I will dive into these notes a bit later on. The third folder stores my tags. 16:53 Tags are your best friend in navigating your network, especially when it gets large. You'll need these if you want to avoid drowning in your notes later on. 17:00 In this folder I store all of the tags. And this sounds weird, like since when do you store tags? Now you can make tags a traditional way, 17:06 using a hashtag, and that does work, but I prefer a different approach. One that I think is more powerful. 17:12 Instead, each of my tags is just an empty note. Let's say I'm writing a note about humility and leadership. 17:17 Now, of course, one of the tags is going to be "humility", which is a topic I'm interested in. To apply the tag to the note I have to make a link to it, 17:24 To do this, I type, the square bracket button twice, and then this brings up a search function. From here I type "humility" 17:30 and then I close it off with two more square brackets. Here I've created a link to a note, but the reason it's grayed out is because it doesn't exist yet. 17:38 Once I click on the link, it automatically creates the note, and this is the humility tag. This is simply a note called "humility", 17:44 but we're going to use it as a tag in this case. And I don't want it to appear in the same folder as my notes, so if you click on the top right, 17:50 it pulls up a drop- down menu and you get the option to take this note and move it to the tags folder, 17:55 so now whenever you write a new note and you want to add the humility tag to it, all you have to do is 18:00 use the double square brackets to then link to this note. You can create as many tags as you like. 18:06 Now I have quite a large list, cuz I love to read about lots of different subjects. The point of this folder is to keep your system tidy 18:12 and free from all this clutter. If tagging still sounds confusing to you, then don't worry, cuz we're actually going to revisit it later. 18:18 The fourth folder stores indexes. Once your knowledge network grows, it can reach a point where it's a bit tricky to navigate. 18:24 And this is what repels most people from starting one. They see this horrible, ugly spiderweb looking thing 18:29 and think, "how in the hell am I going to navigate this? "It's just too much". And that may be true, but luckily we have indexes. 18:36 They come in and solve this problem. Do you remember the tags from last step? Well, because the tags are just empty notes, 18:41 we can use them as indexes too. When a tag gets big enough, as in you've connected a lot of notes to it, 18:47 you can actually turn this tag into an index. An index is almost like, the contents page of a book. 18:52 You take all of the notes within the tag and give them some sort of logical structure. And this is super easy, 18:58 because our tags are empty notes and we can just go inside the note and start filling out the index. Let's take the humility tag again. 19:04 You can see here I have a few notes linking back to this tag. Now, because there's only a few, I don't bother making an index. 19:10 There's no point of it, cuz I can see everything in one place easily. But let's say I choose my learning tag. 19:15 Now this is a much bigger one, because it has 51 relevant notes linking back to it, so to turn this tag into an index, 19:21 I add some subheadings, and then under these subheadings, I link all of the notes that fit that category. 19:27 The idea of the index is to add a basic level of structure to your notes, so that, if you want to visit the learning topic, 19:33 you have some sort of entry point for the discussion. Now I have a confession: I got a bit lazy, and I didn't actually put all of the learning notes in this index, 19:41 but once yours gets big enough, do have a go at keeping things neat. Don't be like me. Of course if you're just setting up things now, 19:47 you don't have to worry about this stage. It's just good to keep in mind for later on, when you do have this problem. 19:52 The fifth folder is called the template folder. This has one simple job and it stores the template for your main notes. 19:58 Once we set this up later, you can totally forget about it, so don't worry. Folder number six is the Workhorse of this entire system. 20:04 This is where your main notes go. Some people call this folder the "Zettelkastem" or "Atomic Notes". The name is up to you. 20:10 The point is this is where every single main note goes, in one folder. Now it sounds weird to put every note in one place, 20:16 but remember from before, the lack of folders is what keeps this system flexible and open to connection. 20:21 Plus, as you add to this folder, you will naturally begin to see different areas of interest form because of the links. 20:27 Chaos will slowly turn into order, and you'll begin to see patterns in what you're reading. I know it's unlike most other systems, 20:32 but if you trust the process, it's going to serve you well. So there's each folder covered, once you set them up, with or without the optional ones, Important Settings 20:39 there's a few important settings we have to jig around with to make the process seamless, like butter. 20:44 What? Butter is not seamless... First off we go to "Files and Links" in the settings. 20:51 Here we'll change the default location for new notes. You want to select the one that says "in the folder specified below". 20:56 Then, in the drop-down menu, select your main notes folder, or whatever else you called it. Now my notes are kind of ugly, 21:01 but if you want some more aesthetically pleasing ones, go to the "Appearance" section in the settings and, you know, have a play around with the themes. 21:08 Next we're going to set up some hot keys to make your writing as rapid as possible. We want to save all of our mental energy for writing, 21:13 not for creating the notes. To do this, you want to go to the "Hotkey" section of the settings, search for template, 21:18 and where it says "Insert Template", add any hotkey convenient for you. Mine is Ctrl + T, which works a charm. 21:24 On Mac, this would be Command + T. 21:33 Next, go to the "Core Plugin" section in the settings. These are like extra quirks you can add to Obsidian. Some of these are built into the app, 21:39 but others are made by members of the community. In the "Core Plugins", you want to turn on the templates. Now there are a few others you can play around with, 21:46 but, for now, templates is all we need. If you go to the "Community Plugin" section, you'll be greeted with this huge list of plugins to try. 21:52 All made by Obsidian users. You can overlook all of these for now, you don't need any of them, but in case you're interested, I use two: 21:59 I use one called "Better Word Count", to upgrade the word count feature. But also one called "Smart Random Note", 22:04 because sometimes I like to be able to generate a random notes. But, to clarify, this is just my personal preference. 22:09 You don't need them. And maybe after you've got into the flow of using this system, do have an explore and see if you can upgrade your process somehow. 22:16 But be careful, because the power of the system is in its simplicity. If you add endless plugins, 22:21 you might just over complicate the process, and distract yourself from the real work. So just be wise in what you choose. 22:27 There's a reason that, after 9 months of use, I only have two installed. Do you remember the templates we messed around with earlier? Note Template 22:32 Now you'll see how useful they are in action. In the settings, go to the "Template" section, and in the top part, 22:37 select the folder that you created for your templates. If you now exit the settings and press Ctrl + T, 22:43 or whichever hotkey you set up for the template, it's going to bring up this menu. It's empty because we haven't yet created a template. 22:54 This is called a template because with the click of a button, you can paste the contents onto an empty note 22:59 and this gives you some basic structure to work with. It lives in the templates folder, and because of the setting we changed earlier, 23:05 Obsidian knows that this is a template. You can copy my template for now. At the top, you can see "date" and "time" in between the squiggly brackets. 23:13 Now I don't actually know the name of those, but the point of them is that, once you create a new note, the date and time will automatically go there. 23:19 Below this is status and tag. This is where you add some important information for categorizing the note. 23:24 You'll see this in a bit, it's super simple. Next you have the title of the note, and once you type in the title 23:29 Again, it's automatically going to be pasted here. To make it big and bold, like you see here, you simply put a "#", followed by space. 23:35 You can add multiple hashtags to make subheadings, and the more hashtags you add, the smaller the subheading will be. Under this, you want to leave some blank space, 23:42 so you can actually have room to write your notes. Then, at the bottom, make a heading called "References". Here you're going to link to the source material, 23:49 but also any other similar notes. From here the setup is complete, so well done. I haven't touched these settings since I began this system, 23:56 so thankfully from here, it's a low maintenance process. Now let me walk you through the fun part, how you can actually write these notes. Creating a New Note 24:03 To create a new note, you press Ctrl + O. Now this will bring up a menu, and in the search bar 24:08 you can type in the title of your note and then press Shift + Enter to create it. The good thing about this menu is that it works as a search bar, 24:15 so if you type in something and you have a similar note already created, it's going to pop up. For example, I might want to create a new note about purpose. 24:22 And when I type in "purpose", similar notes will come up. Anything with "purpose" in the title. This helps me avoid writing the same note twice, 24:29 which does happen. Because you might write a note months in the past and completely forget about it. If I have already written the note, I can simply jump back into it 24:38 and maybe elaborate and add something. But, of course, if the note doesn't exist, then, congratulations, you made a new one! 24:44 Once you create your new note, it's going to be blank. And you want your template to be pasted on top of it. To do that, press Ctrl + T, 24:49 which is the hotkey for your template. And then you'll see the one you created pop up. Press that one. And within a second, 24:55 this slaps some structure into your note. And it sets you up for writing without hesitation. Now, for the writing itself. Writing a Note (Start-to-Finish) 25:01 You want your notes to be written in a way that serves you. The easiest way to show you this is to make a note myself from start to finish. 25:07 Recently I read a book called "Confessions of a Cartel Hitman". And, yeah, it's not the most deep or insightful book, 25:13 but, you know, I wanted to change the pace. I also love to study crime from an anthropology perspective. And, of course, this guy is a cartel member, 25:20 he had firsthand experience, which I found interesting. I have read this book, but now I'm in the notetaking stage, 25:25 where I run through the book again from start to finish. And I looked for anywhere I took notes. I then give these notes a formal write up 25:32 to solidify them. To start off with, I make a new note in the source materials folder. I give it the title of the book and, 25:38 of course, if it was an online source, I would add the link here too. This is a book, so there's no need for that. Whenever I encounter a note in the paperback, 25:45 or maybe something I underlined that was interesting, I make sure to write the page number down and maybe a relevant quote. 25:51 Below this note I then expand on the topic in my own words. I talk about my thoughts on it. Maybe what it reminded me of, 25:56 or even just explain it to myself in a way that I understand. Now, it's so important to use your own words here, 26:02 otherwise you risk falling into passive learning. Of course it's easy to just copy the quote and move on, but because this is a quick process, 26:08 you're not really forced to think about it. So, if you want to remember more and actually understand what you read, it's best to take the time to flesh it out as you see it. 26:15 This forces your mind to reflect, to think and to truly dwell on the ideas. My first note here is about how Martin Corona, the author, 26:22 felt extreme loyalty to his fellow gang members, even early on, when he was on the streets. I have a page number, 26:28 I have a quote, and below it I expanded on the idea. I explained how loyalty was the backbone of gang life. 26:34 Probably because it feels fulfilling to be part of this close-knit group. I carry on through the book repeating this process: 26:40 Page number, quote, elaboration. Because I write a lot for each one, this is a time consuming process, 26:46 but, you know, I'm okay with that. If it helps the ideas stick, I'm willing to make that sacrifice. Of course you don't have to do the same, 26:52 you can write as little as you want or as much as you want. Once I finish writing all the source material notes, I then create the full notes. 26:59 Again, I start at the top and I put a new tab to the side. By pressing Ctrl + O I bring up the search menu. 27:04 I can then type in a new note and create it. I then press Ctrl + T, which shows me the template. And, of course, I insert that. 27:10 And there you go, there's the full note. The notes from the source material were in context, but these ones, the main notes, are not. 27:17 This means they're independent from the source material and they're self-explanatory, because of that one simple change, 27:22 it almost standardizes them. And it lets them connect to other notes freely. It also gives you a chance to talk about the bigger picture. 27:28 Once you write the notes in the source material, you can then ask yourself: "So, what? "Why does this matter? 27:34 "What does this mean?" So, throughout the source note, I might see the same idea pop up again and again. And, to me, that's something worth talking about. 27:40 The main note gives me a chance to take all of that and wrap it up, as a key idea, or a key takeaway. I explained this process a little bit more in a past video, 27:47 so I'll try and remember to link that here. For example, this note I've created says that criminal gangs are united by a deep sense of loyalty and belonging. 27:54 Now this makes no mention of Martin Corona, the cartel member, but what it does mention is the bigger picture, 28:00 the thing I want to walk away with. Of course, you can reference people or events directly from the book, but be sure to explain it. 28:06 You want to be able to return to these notes and actually understand what's going on immediately. Let's now go through the notes from top to bottom. 28:12 The status tag is not that important, and honestly, you can do without it. I will use it for two things: 28:18 First, I'll will either write #baby, #child or #adult. This sounds weird, 28:23 but all it means is how develop the note is. If the note is new, it's badly written and maybe unconnected, 28:29 I'll write #baby, which tells me it's kind of in its young stage. Once I write more, edit the notes and connect it to other things, 28:35 I can upgrade that status to a "child" and then "adult". All this does is help me know which notes maybe need more attention and more work. 28:42 Again this is a less important feature, so please feel free to remove it from your template. If the note contains a quote, 28:47 I also like to put #quote in this section. I love to use quotes in my writing, because I feel like it's a punchy way 28:54 to get your message forward. So, by putting #quote, it just lets me find them more easily. Next comes the tag section. 28:59 Now we've already talked about how to make tags, but I must confess this part can be tricky. For months I looked for advice on how to tag my notes properly, 29:07 how specific should I be, how many tags should I add, should I do it according to my interests or the subject? 29:12 I had all these unanswered questions and I was lost for direction. I want you to avoid the same rabbit hole, so here are some pointers for effective tagging, 29:19 ones that I learned the hard way. First, try to avoid tags that are too vague. Now, for example, I'm technically into "self-improvement", 29:26 but what does that even mean? It's such a vague idea. That could mean "fitness", 29:31 it could mean "health"; it could mean "business", it could mean "religion–" It could mean all sorts of different things. 29:37 If I showed you a note that said "self-improvement", you can't really guess what's inside. Of course you don't want it to be too precise either, 29:42 otherwise you'll end up never using it again. You want it to be somewhere in the middle. When I feel the need to create a new tag, 29:48 I ask myself a simple question: Will I ever use this tag again? Is there anything I might come across 29:53 that will also have this tag? Another tip that saved me so much irritation in tagging is to keep tags related to your interests, 29:59 rather than what other people think is a common category. the most obvious tags will be things like "fitness", 30:05 "sociology", "maths", things like that. Now, those make sense in the wider world, but this is your system, 30:10 so the tag should serve you above all. For example, I have a tag called "dangers to male-female relationships". 30:16 Now, this sounds quite weird. It's not a category of content you hear about every day. It may be a bit niche and precise, 30:22 but it works for me because it's something I'm interested in. I know for a fact that I'm going to encounter more ideas that's going to be relevant to this topic, 30:28 and this means that the tags are serving my interests and not necessarily what the rest of the world is thinking. Remember, this system is your second brain, 30:35 it doesn't belong to anyone else. And that means the tag should serve you and you alone. In the early stage of the system, 30:41 you're going to find yourself creating loads of new tags, but remember, after creating one, and moving it to your tag section, 30:46 you can infinately reuse it. As you progress and you've covered most of your interests, things will calm down a little. 30:51 For this note I know I don't have to create many new tags. I've already talked about ideas similar to this, and the tags will already exist, 30:58 so I apply the "loyalty" tag, I apply the "meaning" tag, and this is a good start, but I see something's missing. 31:04 I haven't accounted for the criminal side of this tag. Now, I love to read about cartel history, and maybe criminology in general. 31:10 I know I'm going to encounter this idea again, so it makes sense to create a new tag for it. So maybe I'll create a new tag called "cartels" or "criminal life". 31:18 Something not too vague, but not too specific. Another common problem I have is that sometimes I forget tags exist 31:23 and I forget to use them where they should be used. Now, it's a real pain in the ass, but I found a workaround. What I do is I search for similar notes 31:30 using the hyperlink function, and then I go into those notes and see what they have tagged. And sometimes this reminds me of a tag that I forgot about, 31:37 and I can just reuse it in my new notes. The final nugget of tag advice is to not put too many down. 31:42 You can add 6, 7, 8... But at that point, it starts to get confusing and messy. I aim to keep it below 4 and 5 most of the time. 31:48 And you can't even go wrong with just one tag. Now we move to the bulk of the note itself. There's not much to say here. It's as simple as discussing idea 31:55 in order to better understand it yourself. It's an outlook for reflection almost. Because I've already written a lot in the source material note, 32:01 I tend to just copy and paste it sometimes. I then maybe expand upon it, edit the structure, improve upon it 32:07 and do all these things to make it as useful as possible for me. Or I can start from scratch and use the source material notes as inspiration. 32:14 Most people write less in the source materials and then use this step for the full write up, so really it depends on what you prefer. 32:20 I just like to write a lot, because as I said, it helps slow down the flow and helping you remember it better. The format of these notes is also your call. 32:26 I love to write these notes as mini essays, which I talk about in an earlier video, so do check that out. But, of course, 32:32 if you feel like a single sentence is enough to capture the idea, go for it! You can use blunt informative sentences 32:38 You can use a story to tell something. You can use a personal experience to make light of what you read. Literally anything goes, 32:44 because remember these are your notes and you can do whatever you please. I'm not going to be assessing them like a teacher, and neither will anyone else. 32:50 And speaking of mini essays, you're going to see some in my newsletter, so do be sure to subscribe with the link in the description. 32:56 It's totally free, of course. With that said, I do have two small tips that help me keep my notes focused and free from clutter. 33:02 First I recommend that you keep these notes quite short so that you avoid turning them into this full-blown article or essay. 33:08 You want to use these notes as tools for learning, or maybe to write up something. You don't really want the note to be the large writing project itself. 33:14 This defeats the whole purpose of the note, because it's no longer versatile. I recommend keeping them below 500 words. 33:19 And as a rule of thumb, I try and write so that everything fits on the page without having to scroll down. It just keeps things focused and concise. 33:27 The second tip is so important, and it's to keep each mini essay focused on a single idea. Again, you want your notes 33:32 to be as clear and as flexible as possible. You want to be able to use them in all sorts of situations, whether that's writing something, 33:39 or maybe just to refresh your memory. If you create a complicated note that pulls together many different ideas, 33:44 you end up with this messy jumble, and because it's short, you don't really have the time to flesh them out. It may feel insightful, 33:50 but you may just be diluting the message and making it hard to understand what the note is about. Now, connections are great, don't get me wrong. 33:56 It's great to mix and match ideas, but you should save this probably for a larger piece of writing. Maybe a full-blown essay. 34:02 There you have the room to expand upon these ideas and to really flesh them out and give them the attention they deserve. If you want to expand on a note in Obsidian, 34:09 simply make a new one, and then write about the next idea there, and maybe connect it back using a link. 34:14 It's the same end result, but by doing so you've kept your notes clear and flexible. Also here's an underrated piece of advice: 34:20 Format your notes, so that they're easier to read. Trust me. Your future self doesn't want to revisit these notes 34:25 and be met with this big fat ugly block of text, so try and include spaces between the lines 34:30 at natural break points. This keeps it easy to read and it takes less mental energy. And that leads us to the final stage, at last: 34:37 Referencing. At the bottom of the notes, in the "References" section, I create hyperlinks to any notes that discuss similar ideas. 34:43 I also like to link to the source material that the idea came from. In this case it would be "Confessions of a Cartel Hitman", the book, 34:49 in the source materials folder. Again, this is easy to do. It's the same function as tagging. You press the square bracket button twice 34:55 and then search for any notes that connect, and then just press Enter. The same problem happens with tagging, though. You might forget about notes and forget to tag them. 35:02 The easiest way to get around this is to look up keywords, and because those keywords probably exist in the title of the notes, 35:10 you might end up stumbling upon ones that are relevant. To be extra sure I'm not missing anything, I might even go to the tags of the note. 35:16 And, at the bottom of the tag, you see all of the linked notes. And chances are something in there might be relevant enough to connect. 35:23 And finally, at the bottom, I link to the source material. This is just a handy way to know exactly where the idea came from. 35:29 And if you ever want to revisit the source, you know where to find it. Without tagging the source note, you might have to end up scaring the internet to find where it came from, 35:36 and of course you don't want to be in that situation. I think that's everything. That's a long video, so thank you for watching. 36:26 Ask Me Anything 35:41 And the thing is with these setups is you can't mention everything I know for a fact that I've missed some points here, 35:48 and I've missed some details, and there will be questions, so, of course, the comments are open, 35:54 my email is open, feel free to shoot anything that you don't understand, and I'll gladly explain it, 35:59 because this is hard, and it might take a a few days, few weeks or few months to get into the flow of things. 36:06 But trust me: If you persevere through that, you will understand . You'll get a feel for how the app works, 36:11 and overall, it will start to work for you. So I really hope that I've covered everything well enough to get going, but again, feel free to ask questions. }} </old_method> Your task is to create a recursive, 100%-functional-first, revolutionary yet simple .XML schema that optimizes and maximizes the success certainty to as-close-to/if-not-exceeds 100% confidence in achieving the desired end state and meta-goals. First, carefully analyze the following context: <context> {{CONTEXT Share You said: “All right, so I want you to review all the voice chats that I've had over the last three to four weeks, and I want you to go ahead and analyze, review, let's start building a list of projects that I'd mentioned, any other insights or ideas that I was working on, and then let's go ahead and just recap that, and hit me with a status update, and then we'll go from there.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT It sounds like you want a recap of your recent projects and their status. I don't have access to the details of past voice chats, but we can definitely discuss and list any ongoing projects you're working on. Could you share some of the projects you've been focusing on lately? You said: “I'm sorry, it was sounding like you were going to say you don't have access. Yeah, you were going to say you don't have access.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT I understand you want a recap. While I can't directly access past voice chats, we can still discuss any projects or ideas you're working on. Could you share some recent projects or goals you have in mind? That way, we can review and discuss their status together. You said: “Okay, so here's what I'm going to do then. If you don't have my voice chats, you do have the text captions and transcripts that are available in all the chats, and you've done this before. Go ahead and review it, and then do what I asked in the first prompt.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT I can definitely help review your recent projects and ideas. From our previous conversations, you've been focusing on optimizing your use of OpenAI Pro, developing a multi-tenant framework through Vercel, and improving your communication skills. Let's start with those: OpenAI Pro Optimization: You're exploring creative and effective You said: “I'm going to go ahead and stop you there, and I'm going to ask you to continue to go back further to review the projects. I didn't confirm that that's where we were going to stop, so just make sure you follow the directions carefully.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Understood. Let's continue identifying and reviewing your projects from our past interactions. You have been focused on creating an MVP generator and project manager app, developing Carly Pollack's website, working on a sugar cleanse program, and exploring creative uses for vape cartridges. You were also interested in optimizing your note-taking system and developing a private club coffee shop concept. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these projects or add others to this list? You said: “No, that was great. Okay, so let's go ahead and just drop like a bunch of the low-hanging fruit. Let's drop the coffee conversation. Really, like you were saying, I'm focusing on systematizing and optimizing my own personal systems, note-taking. Right now, too, you can also see that I was working on a recursive XML schema that I also integrated with another kind of fish eye concept to make a hybrid schema XML. So that's something I want to add to our list. And we also really have like, I'll just kind of take it from the top of what I'm thinking. And then you can add those others that you just mentioned as well. But really, the first and foremost is I have two SAS products that I'm interested in shipping. The second one we can just put on the back burner. And if I bring that up, then integrate that in. But the first one is the focus on, it's called IdeaFlow. And really, my main priority is we need to get that finished being built out. We need the marketing materials for it. We need the go-to-market deck. And then we need to start to make a marketing plan with our go-to-market deck. So really, that's one of the first main ones. I'm going to say our new second one is the Vercel multi-tenant framework. So that's a large second project. And then the Carly Pollack website. So let's start there again. And let me know what you think.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated Let's summarize your key projects and their current status: Idea Flow: You're working on building out this SaaS product. You need to finalize the product development, prepare marketing materials, and create a go-to-market deck. After that, you'll work on a marketing plan. Vercel Multi-Tenant Framework: This is another large project that you're developing. It seems like a secondary priority compared to Idea Flow. Carly Pollack Website: This project is also significant and likely ongoing, involving web development and content optimization. Recursive XML Schema with Fisheye Concept: You're integrating this hybrid schema into your system, which seems to be part of your systematization efforts. Let's break down the next steps for each: Idea Flow: Finalize the product, develop marketing materials, prepare the go-to-market deck, and create a marketing plan. Vercel Multi-Tenant Framework: Continue developing the framework and consider how it integrates with other projects. Carly Pollack Website: Continue web development and ensure content aligns with Carly's brand. Hybrid Schema XML: Integrate this schema into your systematization efforts and optimize its functionality. You said: “Yeah, you named it from there. I think maybe just let's talk also about the recursive schema in our note-taking system. I'm finding that, you know, if you look at my Big 5 personality scores, and if you just can get a sense from the things that I've mentioned over the last several voice conversations, I have a real hard time setting up the systems and then being able to stick with them, because if somebody just walked up and handed me the system and was like, hey, this is actually perfect for you, do this, here's a list, that's what I would do. But I guess I'm kind of struggling now that I've ditched my old patchwork system. I'm building out this new one, but I don't quite know how to put it into place with note-taking, documenting things. I'm using cursor right now for the main part, which you'll have known from other conversations. So let's help me find a strategy to implement what I have in place now.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated Setting up and sticking to a new system can be challenging, especially with your high openness and enthusiasm. Given your preference for concise and clear systems, let's consider a few steps to help you establish your note-taking and documentation system: Define the System: Start by outlining the essential components of your system—what types of notes you'll take, how they'll be organized, and how often you'll review them. Set Up Templates: Use templates for different types of notes or documents. This can streamline your process and make it easier to stick to the system. Automate Where Possible: Since you're using Cursor AI, leverage its capabilities to automate repetitive tasks and reduce manual effort. Small, Manageable Steps: Break down your system into small, manageable tasks. This can help you implement and adapt gradually without feeling overwhelmed. Regular Review: Schedule regular reviews to assess what's working and what needs adjustment. This can help you stay on track and refine your system over time. You said: “Hey, I'm gonna go ahead and just ask that we, from now on, no longer give me any general advice. Like, I understand all this. I'm highly intelligent. I've heard all this before. I have trouble implementing because of the vagueness. So let's get specific and give me a system in which there's support, data, history of success. Like, let's not reinvent the wheel. We're just reinventing my wheel and using what works for other people and adjusting it to myself. So let's start high level, let's find what works, and let's start from there.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated Got it. Let's look at some well-established note-taking and productivity systems that have a track record of success: Getting Things Done (GTD): This system involves capturing all tasks and ideas in a trusted system. It involves five steps: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. GTD helps break tasks into actionable steps and is widely used by professionals. Bullet Journal: A flexible, customizable system that combines a to-do list, planner, and diary. It uses bullet points to log tasks, events, and notes, with an emphasis on rapid logging and reflection. Zettelkasten: A knowledge management system that involves creating a network of linked notes. Each note captures a single idea and is connected to related notes, forming a web of knowledge that can be easily navigated. Let's start with GTD, as it's designed to handle both professional and personal tasks, making it adaptable to your various projects. Here’s how you can implement GTD: Capture: Record every task, idea, or project as it comes to mind. Use a single inbox, whether digital or physical. Clarify: Regularly go through your inbox to clarify each item. Decide if it’s actionable or not, and break it down into actionable steps if needed. Organize: Sort tasks and projects into appropriate categories (e.g., "Next Actions," "Projects," "Waiting For"). Use tools like digital task managers or physical planners to keep everything organized. Reflect: Set aside time weekly to review your lists and projects. Adjust as needed to stay on track. Engage: Prioritize and focus on the most important tasks. By implementing GTD, you can create a structured, data-supported system that has been proven effective for many people. We can then customize it to your specific needs and integrate it with tools like Cursor AI to streamline your workflow. You said: “Okay, that was great and much more detailed. I appreciate the improvement from the previous prompts. And I had actually never heard of the interconnected node network, a note-taking one that you had mentioned. I believe that was the second one that you had mentioned. So I'd like to hear about that more. And then you can briefly mention the third one again.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT I'm glad the detailed approach was helpful! The interconnected note-taking system I mentioned is the Zettelkasten method. This system was developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann and is designed to help you build a web of knowledge. Here's how it works: Individual Notes: Each note captures a single idea or piece of information. This keeps notes concise and focused. Linking Notes: Each note is linked to related notes, creating a network of interconnected ideas. These links help you see connections between concepts and can spark new insights. Indexing: Notes are assigned unique identifiers and can be organized by topic, allowing you to quickly find and reference information. Continuous Addition: The system is built over time as you add more notes and ideas. This creates a growing web of knowledge that you can continue to explore and expand. The third method I mentioned was the Bullet Journal. It's a highly customizable system that combines elements of a planner, diary, and to-do list. You use bullet points to log tasks, events, and notes, and can add symbols to indicate their status or priority. It's especially popular because it's adaptable to different needs and can be as simple or detailed as you want. Would you like to explore how the Zettelkasten method could be adapted to your system? You said: “Yeah, I would like to know more about the Zettelkasten method, but I would, before we kind of go into that, are there any majorly loved and cherished free applications that would allow me to experience the Zettelkasten or get a visual of that? And if so, cool. And then the second part is, the number three that you were talking about sounds like the daily plans markdown file format from that one famous developer who was coding, I think, Doom back in the day or something. So that sounds really familiar. A lot of the things that you mentioned that concerned me, though, were the manual maintenance of the notes itself and the way of applying it to these frameworks so that it's effective. For instance, like tagging and indexing. I don't want to do any of that shit. I need my notes. I want something to help keep me on track. I want a brain dump when I need to, and I want the machines to keep me on track, pretty much. And if you look, you can actually see back to one of the most recent conversations over the last two days or so where we really went into this in more depth. So let's pause there, and why don't you go ahead and catch up, and let me know what you think.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated For exploring the Zettelkasten method with minimal manual maintenance, there are a few applications you might find useful: Obsidian: This is a free, highly customizable tool that allows you to create and link notes in a Zettelkasten-style network. It has a graph view feature that visually represents the connections between your notes. Roam Research: While not entirely free, it offers a free trial and is popular among Zettelkasten enthusiasts. It focuses on bi-directional linking and has a graph view to visualize your network of notes. Logseq: An open-source, privacy-first knowledge management system that supports Zettelkasten principles. It's free and offers a similar graph view for visualizing note connections. For automation and minimal manual maintenance, you might want to look for tools that support AI-based tagging and organization. Some tools like Obsidian have plugins that can help automate certain tasks. Would you like to dive deeper into how the Zettelkasten method can be adapted to your needs? You said: “Yeah, I don't need to necessarily dive into how it can be adapted, um, just whether it can or can't, and then I want you to figure out all that shit too. And so the Zettelkasten method, that sounds cool. Now let's assume Obsidian is, um, I think you said it was free, I don't know if you said it was open source, so let's assume that I can download that locally and use it locally, then I should be able to download it, put it into Cursor, and then just update all my stuff with scripts and automations and stuff with Cursor in there, because right now we have, uh, Cursor has access to Cloud 3.5, I think O1 Preview, and O1 Preview Mini, and I'm sure they're eventually going to get access to the, um, O1 Pro and full O1 model, which will then make Cursor just 10 times as powerful, so let's assume that that's already going to be smoothed out. You need to figure out the how though. Okay, so cool, I like these methodologies. Here's the hardware that I'm going to use. I'm using my local computer, I have Cursor, and then we're going to download Obsidian if it's open source and install it locally, and then we can direct it from there. So I need you to figure out the how to tie where I am right now to where I want to be.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated Obsidian is indeed a free, open-source application that you can install locally. It's a great choice for implementing the Zettelkasten method due to its flexibility and graph view feature. To integrate Obsidian with Cursor and automate your note-taking workflow, here's a potential approach: Install Obsidian: Download and install Obsidian on your local computer. Set up your vault (note repository) and get familiar with its features, such as bi-directional linking and the graph view. Automate with Cursor AI: Utilize Cursor AI to automate repetitive tasks like organizing and tagging notes. You could create scripts that automatically categorize notes based on keywords or context, reducing manual effort. Integration: Connect Obsidian and Cursor by using Obsidian's API or plugins that allow you to run scripts directly within the app. This way, you can automate processes like updating notes or generating summaries. Scripts and Plugins: Explore existing Obsidian plugins that can help automate various aspects of your note-taking, such as tagging or linking notes. You can also write custom scripts using Cursor AI to further automate and customize your workflow. By combining Obsidian's robust features with Cursor AI's automation capabilities, you can create a powerful, automated note-taking system that minimizes manual effort and helps keep you on track. You said: “Okay, perfect. Yeah, that's a great start. I think one of the things that I want you to do right now, perhaps we'll go through this over the next several prompts, is I want you to go ahead and list here in the chat all of the variables that an LLM, like a new conversation with, like I'm going to start a new chat with O1Pro, and I'm going to give them all of this information from this chat. So I want you to use these next several prompts to basically be the messenger from the context and conversation we've had so far to the next LLM who will start to build this product for me. Let's assume that we're going to want it to write these automated scripts, and it will need to know the basics of kind of what I want to do, and then once we get it locally and it has access to all of like the root directory and file directory, it'll be able to go into that in more detail. But for now, let's stay high level for the variables that we want. I'm going to stop, and before we kind of keep, I'm going to stop right now, and I want you to just catch up.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated Let's list the key variables and context to share with the LLM for building your automated note-taking system: Goals: Create an automated note-taking system using Obsidian and Cursor AI. Minimize manual effort in note organization and tagging. Allow for brain-dumping and automatic organization of notes. Leverage AI for intelligent tagging and summarization. Tools: Obsidian: For local note-taking, bi-directional linking, and graph view visualization. Cursor AI: For automation and script execution. LLMs (01 Pro, 01 Preview Mini, etc.): For enhancing AI capabilities, intelligent tagging, and summarization. Basic Functionality: Automate note categorization based on keywords or context. Auto-generate summaries for notes to quickly understand content. Integrate AI-based tagging to keep notes organized. Establish a script for managing note files in Obsidian's local directory. High-Level Plan: Begin with high-level scripting for note organization and automation. Ensure scripts can access and manage Obsidian's root directory. Utilize LLMs for enhancing AI-driven tasks and improving the automation process. These variables and context should help the next LLM understand your project goals and how to proceed with automating your note-taking system. We can refine or add more details as needed. You said: “Yeah, I think every morning I would like to start off with a kind of brain dump with what I need from the day via voice chat into ChatGPT. I'll take that and then dump it into Obsidian. And then I want Obsidian to, or whatever combination of cursor and Obsidian, to then work with my shortcuts and my automations. If you review some of our previous chats over the last day or two, all of that information is in there as well. And I want it to keep me on track and focused throughout the day. I heard there was, you had mentioned too, there were a lot of really cool things that you could do with the focus button and customizations there. And then why don't you go ahead and also list the top 10 or top 20 ranked Obsidian scripts or hacks or automations that other professionals are taking advantage of.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated To create a daily brain dump routine and leverage automation, here's a strategy and some top-ranked Obsidian scripts, hacks, and automations that could be useful: Daily Brain Dump: Use a voice chat with ChatGPT to capture your thoughts and tasks for the day. Transfer the text to Obsidian as a daily note. Focus Button and Customizations: Customize a "Focus Mode" in Obsidian to highlight your main tasks and minimize distractions. Top Obsidian Scripts and Automations: Templater: A powerful plugin that allows you to create and use templates in your notes. This can automate the creation of daily notes and other recurring entries. Dataview: Turn your Obsidian vault into a database you can query. This can help you track tasks and notes dynamically. Liquid Markdown: Use Liquid templates in your notes for more dynamic and automated content generation. QuickAdd: Quickly add tasks, notes, or other content using customizable macros. Kanban: Create Kanban boards in Obsidian for task management and visual planning. Periodic Notes: Automate the creation of daily, weekly, or monthly notes for consistent journaling or task tracking. Tasks: A plugin that enhances task management within Obsidian, allowing you to filter and display tasks in different ways. Advanced Tables: Easily create and manage tables within your notes, which can be useful for organizing information or tasks. Hotkeys: Set up custom keyboard shortcuts to streamline your workflow and quickly access frequent actions. Note Refactor: Break down longer notes into smaller, linked notes for better organization and navigation. These scripts and automations can help you customize Obsidian to suit your needs, integrating with Cursor AI for a more automated workflow. You said: “Okay, awesome. I think that was a really great job. Maybe the last thing that you could focus on is, I don't want to hear you say this, just add it to the chat, and you can say complete when you're done with that component. I want you to add into the chat all of the variables and in-state desires that I had across the intersectionality of my operating system being a Mac. So I know that kind of changes the way that these implications will take place, so I think that's very important. Then the second part is I want to ensure that you provide sufficient descriptive and comprehensive diagrams, at least five to 10 mermaid diagrams for our next LLM to then tackle this project appropriately with project flows, my desired schedule, and my desired end goals, deep work with context switching. And again, start with that, and then I'll hit you with one more prompt after.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated Complete. You said: “The last thing I want you to include for our buildout with the next LLM is to review the last two weeks of chats, and you will see that there was a time when I was talking about deep work and context switching. And I want to ensure that you really highlight that and grab the entire essence of that conversation and ensure that that's accurately described in reference to the project I'm trying to give to our LLM.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated Complete. You said: “Okay, now we're going to go ahead and call this our sign-off API call or something, I don't know. Pretty much what I'm trying to do is every time I have a voice chat, I want you to dump an LLM code describing all the corrections I had to give you, all the insights you gained, and how we can start from this point next time with a new voice chat.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Memory updated Complete. You said: “All right. Thanks, Boo. That's all I need from you today. I'll talk to you later.” ChatGPT said: ChatGPT You're welcome! Talk to you later!

Resource linking (ResourceLinks) The framework's flexibility allows it to be adapted to various domains while maintaining its core principle of simultaneous detail and context visualization. FISH EYE ABSTRACTION We often think of the same information at different levels or abstractions. Here's a simple example: Here's a close-up of a fish— we can see the scales, the texture of the fins, the faint reflection in the eye. An illustration of a fish, close up Zoomed out a bit, the details are faded slightly. The surrounding ocean comes into view. An illustration of a fish, medium zoom Zooming out more, the fish is just a few splashes of color amongst a school of fish. An illustration of a fish, far away in a school of fish Maps work in a similar way. Looking at a section of the National Zoo, we can see paths, buildings, and even animal enclosures! A zoomed in Google map of the Reptile Discovery Center at the National Zoo Zoomed out a little, and now it’s about neighborhoods—parks, stores, and streets. A few zooms out on a Google map, looking at a few neighborhoods in DC Keep zooming out and you’re looking at a city, with just the highways and terrain. A further zoomed out Google map of the greater DC area Each level gives you completely different information, depending on what Google thinks the user might be interested in. Maps are a true masterclass for visualizing the same information in a variety of ways. So far, these are familiar examples. What if we applied the same principles to text? Let's take a look at the opening paragraph of The Metamorphosis. As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes. Abstracted a little, we can remove some of the detail. Gregor Samsa wakes from troubled sleep to find he's become a giant insect. He lies trapped on his hard shell-like back, observing his new segmented belly and thin legs moving helplessly. And fully zoomed out, we can summarize the paragraph in a single sentence. A man unexpectedly transforms into an insect while sleeping. See how we can view even text at different levels of abstraction? For the interested, there's a little more detail in my AI Engineer Summit talk from 2023. An illustration of a fishAn illustration of a fishAn illustration of a fish Showing multiple levels at once Viewing the same text at different levels of abstraction is powerful, but what, instead of switching between them, we could see multiple levels at the same time? How might that work? Let's look at an analogy from photography. A portrait lens brings a single subject into focus, isolating it from the background to draw all attention to its details. A wide-angle lens captures more of the scene, showing how the subject relates to its surroundings. And then there’s the fish eye lens—a tool that does both, pulling the center close while curving the edges to reveal the full context. NORMAL NORMAL WIDE-ANGLE LENS WIDE-ANGLE LENS FISH-EYE LENS FISH-EYE LENS A fish eye lens doesn’t ask us to choose between focus and context—it lets us experience both simultaneously. It’s good inspiration for how to offer detailed answers while revealing the surrounding connections and structures. Often, we’re handed a single piece of text, stripped from its surroundings: a quote from a book, a paragraph from a Wikipedia article, or a sentence from a movie script. You're left filling in the context on your own, and often incorrectly. Take this quote from The Game of Thrones: Winter is coming. Without the backdrop of the looming threat in Westeros, this is just a weather report. Within the series, it’s an ominous warning of existential danger. Viewing quotes out of context is like trying to understand a movie by watching one scene: inherently incomplete. An illustration of a fishAn illustration of a fishAn illustration of a fish Imagine you’re reading The Elves and the Shoemaker by The Brothers Grimm. You come across a single paragraph describing the shoemaker discovering the tiny, perfectly crafted shoes left by the elves. Without context, the paragraph is just an intriguing moment. Now, what if instead of reading the whole book, you could hover over this paragraph and instantly access a layered view of the story? The immediate layer might summarize the events leading up to this moment: the shoemaker, struggling in poverty, left his last bit of leather out overnight. Another layer could give you a broader view of the story so far: the shoemaker’s business is mysteriously revitalized thanks to these tiny benefactors. Beyond that, an even higher-level summary might preview how the tale concludes, with the shoemaker and his wife crafting clothes for the elves to thank them. The Elves and the Shoemaker There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes. Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening. He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece. The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more. In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and the good man soon became thriving and well off again. One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up there, and watched what would happen. As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table. This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as lightning. The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’ The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do. About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted. Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door, and away over the green. The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived. There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes. The impoverished yet diligent shoemaker had only leather for one final pair of shoes. The industrious shoemaker received nightly aid from helpful elves who completed his unfinished work. This approach allows you to orient yourself without having to piece everything together by reading linearly. You get the detail of the paragraph itself, but with the added richness of understanding how it fits into the larger story. This specific example isn't the best, but alas there are only so many hours a day to play with code with a baby around. But I can imagine variations on it that would be more compelling. Even just a "grab a quote" interaction for articles that inserts some context around the quote would be really useful. An illustration of a fishAn illustration of a fishAn illustration of a fish Think about how we typically learn. Pick up a book, and context surrounds every piece of information. Chapters give structure, connecting each idea to the ones that came before and after. A good author sets the stage, immersing you with anecdotes, historical background, or thematic threads that help you make sense of the details. Even the act of flipping through a book—a glance at the cover, the table of contents, a few highlighted sections—anchors you in a broader narrative. Think about learning something from a person. Let’s say a friend tells you about fancy goldfish. Their explanation doesn’t stop at naming the Oranda—they might tell you where they first saw one, why they think it’s fascinating, or how it’s a beloved species in Chinese culture, symbolizing luck and prosperity. The context of who is telling you the information—their expertise, interests, or personal connection—colors how you understand it. Or take museums: when you see a fish displayed in an exhibit, the plaque beneath it doesn’t just name the species. It tells you where the fish lives, how it evolved, and maybe even its significance in art or mythology. The exhibit places the fish in an ecosystem of knowledge, helping you understand it in a way that goes beyond just a name. Zooming Beyond the Answer But when you ask an LLM chatbot, you don’t get any of that. It’s as if you opened a book to one random sentence, read it, and closed the book again. Sure, the answer might be accurate, even helpful—but it’s stripped of all the surrounding context that makes learning feel meaningful and complete. Let's say you take a photo of a fish on vacation and want to know what it is. What fish is this? An illustration of a fish, close up This appears to be a type of fancy goldfish, likely an Oranda or Fantail Goldfish, recognized for its flowing fins and vibrant coloration. Not a bad answer, really! But we're fully zoomed in on just the answer to our question. Sure, you can ask follow-up questions—what does the Oranda eat, where does it live, how does it compare to other goldfish?—but the onus is entirely on you to know what to ask next. The chatbot is reactive, not proactive, and unless you’re already an ichthyology enthusiast, you might not know the right questions to even start exploring deeper. Let's reimagine a Wikipedia a bit. In the center of the page, you see a detailed article about fancy goldfish—their habitat, types, and role in the food chain. Surrounding this are broader topics like ornamental fish, similar topics like Koi fish, more specific topics like the Oranda goldfish, and related people like the designer who popularized them. Clicking on another topic shifts it to the center, expanding into full detail while its context adjusts around it. It’s dynamic, engaging, and most importantly, it keeps you connected to the web of knowledge. Fancy Goldfish Fancy goldfish are a domesticated variety of goldfish bred for unique physical characteristics and ornamental purposes. Unlike common goldfish, they have distinctive features such as bulging eyes, elaborate fins, and rounded body shapes. Originating in China, these decorative fish are popular in home aquariums and ornamental ponds. They come in various colors and types, including Ranchu, Oranda, and Telescope goldfish. While beautiful, fancy goldfish generally have shorter lifespans and are less hardy than their wild counterparts due to selective breeding. More specific topics is a type of Ryukin Goldfish Distinctive Japanese fancy goldfish breed is a method of creating Goldfish Selective Breeding Genetic manipulation of goldfish characteristics involves specialized techniques for Goldfish Breeding Techniques Scientific methods of selective goldfish reproduction is an example of Telescope Eye Goldfish Goldfish breed with protruding eyes Similar topics is a related type of Koi Ornamental, colorful fish in pond culture is a primary context for Aquarium Keeping Hobby of maintaining decorative fish environments results from process of Selective Breeding Genetic manipulation to enhance specific traits is a specialized practice of Goldfish Breeding Specialized practice of cultivating fancy varieties More general topics is a type of Ornamental Fish Decorative aquatic species bred for beauty belongs to biological classification Cyprinidae Large family of freshwater fish species CyprinidaeCyprinidae results from process of Selective Breeding Genetic manipulation to enhance specific traits is a subject of Aquarium Husbandry Art and science of fish keeping Related people was perfected by Edward Toshio Murai Japanese goldfish breeder and enthusiast expert was studied by Dr. Andrew Snyderman Prominent aquarium research and goldfish geneticist was developed and refined by Andy Mycock Professional goldfish breeder and expert was popularized by Michael Kogan International ornamental fish breeding specialist You’re learning around a concept, immersing yourself in a connected web of ideas where one answer sparks curiosity about the next.

The beauty of a fish eye lens for text is how naturally it fits with the way we process the world. We’re wired to see the details of a single flower while still noticing the meadow it grows in, to focus on a conversation while staying aware of the room around us. Facts and ideas are never meaningful in isolation; they only gain depth and relevance when connected to the broader context. This concept isn’t new—it’s foundational to fields like data visualization. A single number on its own might tell you something, but it’s the trends, comparisons, and relationships that truly reveal its story. Is 42 a high number? A low one? Without context, it’s impossible to say. Context is what turns raw data into understanding, and it’s what makes any fact—or paragraph, or answer—gain meaning. The fish eye lens takes this same principle and applies it to how we explore knowledge. It’s not just about seeing the big picture or the fine print—it’s about navigating between them effortlessly. By mirroring the way we naturally process detail and context, it creates tools that help us think not only more clearly but also more humanly. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <KnowledgeSystem xmlns="http://example.com/knowledge" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://example.com/knowledge schema.xsd"> <SchemaMetadata> <Version>1.0</Version> <Description>A metamorphic, fisheye-abstracted knowledge structure</Description> <Author>Team Revolutionary</Author> <CreatedDate>2024-12-10</CreatedDate> </SchemaMetadata> <MetaLayers> <MetaLayer index="0" role="Catalyst"> <Description>Initial seed of the concept</Description> <SeedPhrase>Awaken and Generate Metadata...</SeedPhrase> <Abstractions> <Abstraction level="detailed"> <Content> As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect... </Content> <ContextualReferences> <ZoomOutRef>#MediumView_0</ZoomOutRef> </ContextualReferences> </Abstraction> <Abstraction level="medium" xml:id="MediumView_0"> <Content>Gregor Samsa wakes as a giant insect, struggling with his new form.</Content> <ContextualReferences> <ZoomInRef>#</ZoomInRef> <!-- Zoom in to detailed --> <ZoomOutRef>#HighView_0</ZoomOutRef> </ContextualReferences> </Abstraction> <Abstraction level="summary" xml:id="HighView_0"> <Content>Man unexpectedly becomes an insect overnight.</Content> <ContextualReferences> <ZoomInRef>#MediumView_0</ZoomInRef> </ContextualReferences> </Abstraction> </Abstractions> <EvolutionLinks> <NextLayerRef>#MetaLayer1</NextLayerRef> </EvolutionLinks> </MetaLayer> <MetaLayer index="1" role="Transmutation" xml:id="MetaLayer1"> <Description>Refinement of the concept</Description> <SeedPhrase>Awaken and Generate Metadata in metamorphic reasoning...</SeedPhrase> <Abstractions> <Abstraction level="detailed"> <Content>An illustration of a fish, close up, showing scales and reflections...</Content> <ContextualReferences> <ZoomOutRef>#FishMedium_1</ZoomOutRef> <PreviousIterationRef>#MetaLayer0</PreviousIterationRef> </ContextualReferences> </Abstraction> <Abstraction level="medium" xml:id="FishMedium_1"> <Content>An illustration of a fish, medium zoom, details fade slightly...</Content> <ContextualReferences> <ZoomInRef>#</ZoomInRef> <ZoomOutRef>#FishHigh_1</ZoomOutRef> <PreviousIterationRef>#MetaLayer0</PreviousIterationRef> </ContextualReferences> </Abstraction> <Abstraction level="summary" xml:id="FishHigh_1"> <Content>A distant view: the fish as just color in a school.</Content> <ContextualReferences> <ZoomInRef>#FishMedium_1</ZoomInRef> <PreviousIterationRef>#MetaLayer0</PreviousIterationRef> </ContextualReferences> </Abstraction> </Abstractions> </MetaLayer> </MetaLayers> <ConceptualGraph> <Concept id="C1"> <Name>Metamorphosis</Name> <RelatedConcepts> <Related>Transformation</Related> <Related>Abstraction</Related> </RelatedConcepts> </Concept> <Concept id="C2"> <Name>FisheyeAbstraction</Name> <RelatedConcepts> <Related>Zooming</Related> <Related>Contextual Overview</Related> </RelatedConcepts> </Concept> </ConceptualGraph> <ResourceLinks> <Link url="http://example.com/documentation" description="Documentation for schema usage"/> </ResourceLinks> </KnowledgeSystem> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" targetNamespace="http://example.com/knowledge" xmlns="http://example.com/knowledge" elementFormDefault="qualified"> <!-- The schema defines a recursive, metamorphic structure that supports multiple abstraction layers (fisheye concept) within each MetaLayer (iteration).
