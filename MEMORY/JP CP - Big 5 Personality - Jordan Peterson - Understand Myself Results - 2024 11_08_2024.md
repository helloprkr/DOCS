`Relationship Report with Carly Pollack [carlypollack@gmail.com]`  
`===============================================================`

`This is the relationship/couple report you created when you linked your assessment to the assessment of your partner, Carly Pollack [carlypollack@gmail.com]. As you know, the Big Five Aspects Scale is a personality assessment that assesses where you stand in comparison to others in the general population on the five major traits and their aspects:`

`-   Agreeableness: Compassion and Politeness`  
`-   Conscientiousness: Industriousness and Orderliness`  
`-   Extraversion: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness`  
`-   Neuroticism: Withdrawal and Volatility`  
`-   Openness to Experience: Intellect and Aesthetics`

`In the original Big Five Aspects Scale model, the openness factor was entitled "Openness to Experience," and its aspects were called "Intellect" and "Openness". For the sake of clarity, we have deviated from this, and use "Openness" or "Openness to Experience" to refer to the factor level trait and "Intellect" and "Aesthetics" to refer to its aspects.`

`This report has five main sections, one for each of the traits. Each section includes your score for the trait and a brief summary of what that score may imply about you; your partner's score and a description of what their score may imply about them; and a description of what you and your partner may expect as a couple based on your respective scores. Each section includes two additional subsections, each covering one of the two aspects of that trait. Each aspect subsection includes your score and your partner's score for the aspect, along with a qualitative description for each, and a description of what your respective scores may imply for you two as a couple.`

`We have introduced a simplification into the structure of this report that may cause some confusion because it deviates from the format used in the individual report. For the individual reports, we use nine descriptive levels: "exceptionally low", "very low", "low", "moderately low", "typical or average", "moderately high", "high", "very high", and "exceptionally high". For this report we use five descriptive levels to cover the same range of scores: "very low", "low", "typical or average", "high", and "very high". Whereas, for a given trait score your individual report may have described you as "exceptionally high", or "very high", in this report your score may be described simply as "very high". You will find the same numerical value for the trait score in both reports, but you may find some differences in the language used to describe the score.`

`Agreeableness`  
`-------------`

`Agreeableness is a big five personality trait associated with how people weigh their own interests against those of others. Simply put, agreeableness is how much you pay attention to and care about other people's feelings, needs, and desires. Agreeable people are kind, nurturing, compliant, and trusting. Disagreeable people are competitive, tough, blunt, and skeptical.`

`Personality psychologists have determined that there are two separable aspects of agreeableness: compassion and politeness. Compassion is about sensitivity to others' needs -- caring for people -- while politeness is about sensitivity to others' wants -- attending to social norms and pleasing others.`

`### You are Typical or Average in Agreeableness`

`Your score puts you at the **50th** percentile for agreeableness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in agreeableness than **49** of them and higher in agreeableness than **50** of them.`

`You are typical or average in agreeableness. People who are typical in agreeableness can sometimes be sensitive, cooperative, trusting and forgiving, and sometimes argumentative, competitive, and honest, as romantic partners. They tend to employ both cooperative and competitive strategies, and do not particularly avoid conflict. They are reasonably skeptical of others, but can excuse or ignore their partner's misbehavior and error. They can defer to others, but can also take on positions of authority. People who are typical in agreeableness are typically willing to engage in enough conflict to avoid developing resentment in their relationship, although they may also sometimes sacrifice medium- to long-term stability for the sake of short-term peace.`

`##### Agreeableness`

`### 50th percentile`

`Higher in agreeableness than 50 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is High in Agreeableness`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **88th** percentile for agreeableness. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in agreeableness than **11** of them and higher in agreeableness than **88** of them.`

`Your partner is high in agreeableness. Agreeable people make sensitive, cooperative, trusting, and forgiving romantic partners. They prefer cooperation to competition, and like to avoid conflict. Agreeable people tend to give their romantic partner the benefit of the doubt, and to be flexible and patient. They tend to defer to others, and are less comfortable in positions of authority. In the extreme, they can be naïve and easily exploited. They may become resentful and use passive aggression in relationships if their needs are not met. Because they are likely to avoid conflict, even when it is necessary, they may allow small problems to accumulate counterproductively. This can sacrifice medium- to long-term stability for the sake of short-term peace. These agreeable tendencies can be reduced by high levels of assertiveness, an aspect of extraversion.`

`#####  Agreeableness`

`### 88th percentile`

`Higher in agreeableness than 88 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Agreeableness as a Couple`

`You are typical in agreeableness and your partner is high in agreeableness.`

`This means the two of you have somewhat different strategies for dealing with the world, which can be beneficial for you as a couple. However, this may present a challenge within your relationship because you may have trouble understanding one another at times. You'll have to be careful to avoid the pitfalls of your respective personality traits. However, your relationship is fairly balanced in this trait overall.`

`You and your partner are slightly different in agreeableness.`

`This may present a problem to your relationship at times, although your difference is not very big. You may, at times, find it difficult to understand each other's motivations and actions, as well as have difficulties communicating your needs and negotiating.`

`You will differ very slightly in your account of others and how concerned you are with the emotional state of your partner, as well as your opinions of other people, and your interpretations of their motives.`

`You can use your differences to your advantage, each helping one another to develop the virtues of the opposite trait. Personality psychologists believe that differences in both aspects of agreeableness are linked to clusters of genetic differences. Although it is possible to develop one's personality over time, it's also necessary to accept your innate differences to some degree.`

`### Agreeableness: Behavioral Roles`

`You are slightly lower in agreeableness than your partner. Although you are similar in agreeableness, you may still take on complementary roles in your relationship.`

`You will tend to see your partner as a bit naïve, over-sympathetic and easily taken advantage of. Your partner may wish you could be less argumentative, self-oriented, more cooperative, more likely to apologize, and kinder.`

`You will be a bit blunter, tougher and more stubborn than your partner, as well as more likely to push things forward in the way you want them. You will have to be somewhat careful to make sure your partner does not feel taken advantage of, as this will cause problems such as resentment in the long run. You will also have to be somewhat careful to properly take the wishes and desires of your partner into account, not least particularly because your partner may struggle to be forthright with you about their needs. You will have to encourage your partner to communicate their needs.`

`Your partner will be a little more compassionate, caring, empathetic, self-sacrificing and polite than you. Your partner will take somewhat more account of and care for others, and will be more concerned with your emotional state than you are of theirs. In your day-to-day life together, you will be a little more likely to engage in conflict or negotiations on your joint behalf, while your partner will be perhaps more likely to manage others' emotions, send people cards and gifts, and to help others (like taking care of a sick pet or child).`

`You can help your partner avoid the problems associated with being too accommodating, and too likely to assume that everyone has only positive motives. You can help your partner learn to negotiate with difficult people, and further his or her own career, educational and personal interests. Your partner can help you to think more about others and get along with them better, as well as to cooperate and trust when appropriate. You will sometimes have to be careful not to impose your own will so strongly that your partner's needs are ignored and neglected. Your partner will have to make an effort to communicate his or her personal, self-oriented needs in a straightforward manner.`

`### Agreeableness: Your Virtues and Faults as a Couple`

`You will generally be able to stand up to each other when you disagree, and should both be able to put your point forward and to listen well enough so that negotiating with each other won't be too much of a problem (this will be particularly true if one or both of you is also low in neuroticism). Since you are lower in agreeableness, this may be a bit easier for you than it is for your partner. You will take turns leading and following, although you will tend to lead a bit more often than you follow.`

`Occasionally, one of you will be too pushy and the other unforthcoming and resentful, but that shouldn't happen with undue frequency. You should also be able to discuss and negotiate successfully with others in most cases, and to help each other in such endeavors. You are both reasonably well-disposed to other people and appropriately trusting, although you may risk being naive. You should, however, be able to benefit from the offer of cooperative endeavors, family relationships and friendships when they are available, without taking advantage or being taken advantage of.`

`In your sex life together, you will be able to ask for what you need and to seek your own satisfaction, while also serving your partner's needs. Because your partner is higher in agreeableness, he or she may have trouble advocating on his or her own behalf. He or she may be tempted to lie about his or her satisfaction or to fake an orgasm, but your partner would undermine his or her sexual fulfillment by lying. You should both do your best to communicate your needs (either verbally or nonverbally), otherwise, you could end up resentful or unsatisfied.`

`If and when you have children, you will tend to be firm but appropriately caring, while your partner will tend to do too much for them. In other words, you will tend toward an authoritative parenting style, which is characterized by making reasonable demands of your children while being responsive to their needs and wishes. Your partner will tend toward a permissive parenting style, which is characterized by making relatively low demands of your children while being highly responsive to their needs and wishes. Together, you should aim for an authoritative parenting style, where you are appropriately caring and demanding of your children. It's important to maintain consistency in parenting and to form a united front. You will have to learn how to jointly set boundaries, so that the more disagreeable partner is not too often the disciplinarian and the more agreeable partner too often the parent who says yes and is liked but not respected.`

`Compassion`  
`----------`

`Compassion is an aspect of the big five factor agreeableness. Simply put, it is a measure of a person's orientation toward the interests and needs of others, as opposed to their own interests and needs. People who score higher in compassion are more interested in the concerns of other people, more likely to be described as caring and kind, and often have difficulty advocating on their own behalf. People who score lower in compassion are less interested in the concerns of other people, less likely to be described as caring and kind (although they may certainly still be this way), and are usually comfortable advocating on their own behalf.`

`### You are Very High in Compassion`

`Your score puts you at the **95th** percentile for compassion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in compassion than **4** of them and higher in compassion than **95** of them.`

`You are very high in the aspect of compassion. This means you are likely extremely oriented toward the problems of other people and other living things. You won't be at all likely to push your partner psychologically or argue with him or her, because you will be concerned about causing him or her negative emotion. You will do kind things for your partner, even at the expense of your own needs. People, including your partner, will see you as highly empathetic and caring, and will often turn to you for a listening ear. However, you are likely to have significant trouble negotiating on your own behalf, in your romantic relationships and otherwise. You may be exploited, if you are not careful to advocate for your own needs. You risk becoming resentful or angry in your relationship if you do not take care to communicate your needs.`

`#####  Compassion`

`### 95th percentile`

`Higher in compassion than 95 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Very High in Compassion`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **96th** percentile for compassion. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in compassion than **3** of them and higher in compassion than **96** of them.`

`Your partner is very high in compassion. People who are very high in compassion are extremely interested in the problems of other people, and other living things, particularly if those people or things are young or helpless. They are highly concerned about helping others, including their partners, avoid negative emotion. They make more time and do more kind things for others, even when doing so may interfere with fulfilling their own needs and interests. They have an extremely soft side. Other people, including their partner, consider them very sympathetic and nice, and will turn to them often for a listening ear. They are highly empathetic and caring. However, because they are so other-oriented, they are likely to find it difficult to negotiate on their own behalf in the relationship. This can lead to resentment.`

`#####  Compassion`

`### 96th percentile`

`Higher in compassion than 96 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Compassion as a Couple`

`You are very high in the aspect of compassion, and your partner is very high in the aspect of compassion.`

`Because you align closely in the aspect of compassion, you will each easily understand your partner's thoughts, interests, and ideas having to do with this aspect. You will be approximately equally concerned or unconcerned with the interests of other people.`

`Because you are both very high in compassion, you are likely to be primarily oriented toward the problems of other people and other living beings. You are extremely unlikely to be competitive with one another or in other domains, preferring instead a strategy of cooperation. You are both very likely to do kind things for others, including your partner, frequently and sometimes at the expense of your own needs.`

`You are both likely to be extremely conflict-averse. This may mean you have trouble engaging in conflict, even when it is necessary. You will both be very concerned about causing your partner negative emotion during disagreements, and you may find it easier to avoid disagreement altogether. However, this can cause each of you to harbor resentment against your partner, so it is important to discuss problems in your relationship as they arise.`

`Politeness`  
`----------`

`Politeness is an aspect of the big five factor agreeableness. Simply put, it is a measure of a person's obedience, deference to authority, and their sensitivity to social norms. People who score higher in politeness are deferential, respectful of norms, and conflict-averse. People who score lower in politeness are less deferential, less respectful of norms, and more comfortable challenging other people. People who are high in compassion avoid conflict for fear of making others feel negative emotion, while people who are high in politeness avoid conflict for fear of making themselves feel negative emotion.`

`It is important to note that the term "politeness" is a bit of a misnomer. While the name implies that people low in politeness might be impolite or even rude, this is certainly not always the case. The majority of people who receive a low score in politeness are pleasant, reasonable people, who also have a tendency to question authority and challenge others. Comedians and other humorous people tend to be low in politeness.`

`### You are Very Low in Politeness`

`Your score puts you at the **3rd** percentile for politeness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in politeness than **96** of them and higher in politeness than **3** of them.`

`You are very low in the aspect of politeness. This means you are highly unlikely to be obedient or deferential to authority. You may be very respectful, but only to those who earn it. You are likely to be quite willing to push back against someone when you are challenged. You are far more comfortable than average with confrontation, and may even enjoy it. You do not at all avoid conflict, at least not for fear of experiencing negative emotion during the conflict. You may find yourself in trouble from time to time. You are fairly unconcerned with social norms, and will find yourself questioning them often, especially if you are also high in openness to experience. You are likely to be very skeptical, and as such, you may have trouble fitting in at the bottom of dominance hierarchies due to your incessant questioning. You are likely to be a dominant type, rather than a submissive type, especially if you are low in neuroticism and/or high in assertiveness (an aspect of extraversion).`

`#####  Politeness`

`### 3rd percentile`

`Lower in politeness than 96 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Typical or Average in Politeness`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **58th** percentile for politeness. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in politeness than **41** of them and higher in politeness than **58** of them.`

`Your partner is typical in politeness. People who are typical in politeness can be deferential to authority, but can also be challenging, when necessary. They are not particularly obedient. They can be respectful, but will also push back if pushed. They are not made uncomfortable by the necessity of standing up to other people, including their partners. Typically polite people will avoid conflict, reasonably, but are not completely averse to confrontation.`

`##### Politeness`

`### 58th percentile`

`Higher in politeness than 58 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Politeness as a Couple`

`You are very low in the aspect of politeness, and your partner is typical in the aspect of politeness.`

`You and your partner are somewhat different in this aspect. This may present a problem to your relationship in accordance with the strength of the difference. You may find it difficult to understand each other's motivations, perceptions, and actions having to do with this aspect. A difference in one aspect can be mitigated by a better match on other traits and aspects, however.`

`Because you are very low in politeness, you will be not at all obedient, or deferential to authority. Your partner can defer to authority, and will usually be reasonably, although not markedly obedient. You are likely to very much enjoy challenging authority and engaging in conflict, and your partner will be comfortable with these things only when he or she sees that they are clearly necessary. You risk being much more confrontational than necessary, but your partner's tendencies may help balance you out.`

`You will tend to play a very dominant behavioral role (particularly if you are also high in assertiveness, an aspect of extraversion), while your partner will not be particularly dominant or submissive. Your tendencies may encourage your partner to be more submissive, however.`

`Conscientiousness`  
`-----------------`

`Conscientiousness is a big five personality trait associated with attention to detail, hard work, persistence, and orderliness, as well as adherence to rules, standards, and processes. Conscientious people are careful, reliable, organized, self-disciplined, and persevering. Unconscientious people tend to be more laid-back, less orderly, more inconsistent, and less reliable. They are more likely to procrastinate, and are less likely to persist when pursuing their goals.`

`Personality psychologists have determined that there are two separable aspects of conscientiousness: industriousness and orderliness. Industriousness is associated with the hardworking, dedicated, responsible, and dependable aspect of conscientiousness. Orderliness is associated with attention to detail, disgust sensitivity, organization, and precision. We will first discuss your results for the trait of conscientiousness overall, and later its two aspects.`

`### You are Low in Conscientiousness`

`Your score puts you at the **11th** percentile for conscientiousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in conscientiousness than **88** of them and higher in conscientiousness than **11** of them.`

`You are low in conscientiousness. People who are low in conscientiousness make relaxed, flexible, and non-judgmental romantic partners. They are not obsessive, rigid, or tyrannical. As romantic partners, however, they may sometimes avoid the work necessary to make the relationship succeed. They like to live in the moment and figure things out as they go, which can make them fun to be around, particularly if they are also extroverted. On the negative side, they are less ambitious than other people, and may come off as underachievers, prone to making excuses and wasting their time. People who are unconscientious may also be less interested in marriage, as they are less goal-oriented and may be less bothered by an undefined relationship or one that is not "progressing".`

`#####  Conscientiousness`

`### 11th percentile`

`Lower in conscientiousness than 88 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Very High in Conscientiousness`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **98th** percentile for conscientiousness. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in conscientiousness than **1** of them and higher in conscientiousness than **98** of them.`

`Your partner is very high in conscientiousness. People who are very high in conscientiousness make dedicated, reliable, and committed romantic partners. They are extremely prone to guilt. They are extremely dutiful, and will work hard without being pushed to do so. If they feel they have made a mistake in the relationship, they are likely to feel far higher than average levels of guilt and shame. As romantic partners, conscientious people usually put in the effort necessary to maintain the relationship. They will want to do everything they can to improve the relationship. They are highly concerned by failure, and will tend to formulate personal explanations for lack of success. They're committed to the idea of personal responsibility, and are convinced that those who work hard should be rewarded. They will be goal-oriented, and may therefore be more likely to pursue marriage, particularly if they see it as a goal worth pursuing.`

`#####  Conscientiousness`

`### 98th percentile`

`Higher in conscientiousness than 98 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Conscientiousness as a Couple`

`You are low in conscientiousness, and your partner is very high in conscientiousness.`

`This means the two of you have significantly different strategies for dealing with the world, which can be beneficial for you as a couple. However, this may present a challenge within your relationship because you may have trouble understanding one another at times. You'll have to be careful to avoid the pitfalls of your respective personality traits.`

`You and your partner are significantly different in conscientiousness.`

`You will sometimes find it difficult to understand each other's drives and motivations, and what you find important. You will sometimes disagree on the best course of action in a particular situation. You will also differ in your drive for achievement and ambition, and in how disturbed you are by disorder and chaos (with the partner lower in conscientiousness much less bothered). The two of you may disagree about how carefully, quickly, and effectively household tasks need to be done. You may find you want very different lifestyles, and you may also have trouble dividing the household labor fairly if your standards do not line up. This will present a problem to your relationship in accordance with the strength of the difference.`

`You can use your differences to your advantage, each helping one another to develop the virtues of the opposite trait. Personality psychologists believe that differences in both aspects of conscientiousness are linked to clusters of genetic differences. Although it is possible to develop one's personality over time, it's also necessary to accept your innate differences to some degree.`

`### Conscientiousness: Behavioral Roles`

`You are significantly lower in conscientiousness than your partner. You will tend to see your partner as rigid, judgmental, obsessive, and overly hard-working at times. Your partner will tend to see you as lazy, messy, and careless at times.`

`Your partner will be much more orderly, industrious, ambitious, work-oriented, driven, efficient and prone to failure-related shame and guilt than you will be. Your partner will be more likely to succeed in their work or educational pursuits than you are. You will be less likely to obsess about small details, work to the exclusion of all else, and to be overcome with ambition.`

`Your partner will have a much higher sensitivity and lower threshold for cleaning, tidying, and organizing than you will. This could mean that your partner does all of this type of work, since they are more sensitive to it. You will have to take care to divide the household tasks fairly and to agree on reasonable standards together.`

`Your partner is a lot more likely to want to be doing something productive or cleaning up and tidying and organizing rather than relaxing. You will be more likely to take time off work to attend to other things, like leisure, family, travel, and fun. You can help your partner be more relaxed, take things less seriously, and take time off, while he or she can help you to apply yourself, to work hard, and to pursue goals.`

`### Conscientiousness: Your Virtues and Faults as a Couple`

`The two of you differ quite a lot in how hard you like to work and how clean you like to keep things. Frequently, your partner may feel like you aren't working hard enough, and like you are too messy and careless. The two of you are very likely to clash about how carefully, quickly and effectively household tasks (for example) need to be done.`

`Your partner may have a hard time loosening up enough to let something creative, messy or new happen. He or she may become a prisoner of rigid routine and habit. You can help your partner by encouraging them to loosen up from time to time, as well as to relax. You can help your partner feel like he or she can relax by contributing your fair share around the house and staying on top of things.`

`You might have the tendency to let tasks slide until you get into trouble. Sometimes it will be your partner with whom you are in trouble, and this dynamic is not good for the relationship. Your partner can help you by encouraging you to work hard, apply yourself, and learn some discipline. You can help yourself by making and sticking to a schedule.`

`Conscientiousness predicts marital stability and a low likelihood of divorce. Since you are low or very low in conscientiousness, you may be predisposed to have a less stable marriage and to experience divorce. Your partner, however, is unlikely to engage in behaviors that increase the likelihood of these outcomes. Part of this is owing to the fact that conscientious people are concerned with maintaining their relationship, and they feel guilty when they hurt their partner or the relationship. You may be able to improve the stability of your relationship by having regular conversations with your romantic partner. Low conscientiousness predicts infidelity in a relationship, although many other traits and personal choices affect this behavior as well.`

`Your partner will be much more likely to pursue academic and career success, and to work hard for those pursuits. You are more likely to choose a career that is not too taxing and that will allow you the free time you want. Your partner, however, is likely to be more motivated to pursue success and status in his or her career. He or she may also make more money than you do, since conscientiousness predicts income. Depending on your specific situation, this may cause some imbalance in the relationship. This may mean you will get to benefit from your partner's money, and status, or their clean home and organized life. Your partner may feel taken advantage of, especially if they do not feel like you are pulling your weight. This may cause problems in your relationship if you don't handle it well.`

`Your partner is also much more likely to be responsible with money, and will be more likely to feel guilty about inappropriate spending and saving habits. You are likely to be significantly less guilt-prone, and so are likely to be less concerned with responsible financial behavior.`

`Industriousness`  
`---------------`

`Industriousness is an aspect of the big five factor conscientiousness. Simply put, it is a measure of how much a person values hard work, and how guilty they feel when they do not meet expectations. People who are higher in industriousness tend to finish what they start, to adhere to schedules, and to feel shame when they fail to meet their obligations. People who are lower in industriousness are more likely to procrastinate, to fall behind on schedules, and they do not feel as guilty when they fail to meet their obligations. Industriousness predicts a person's income and success in academic and workplace settings, in particular, in managerial and administrative roles.`

`### You are Typical or Average in Industriousness`

`Your score puts you at the **32nd** percentile for industriousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in industriousness than **67** of them and higher in industriousness than **32** of them.`

`You are typical in the aspect of industriousness. This means you are about average in terms of how much you value hard work, and that you will likely experience a normal proclivity toward procrastination. You will be reasonably concerned with schedules, timelines, and efficiency, although not particularly so. You are likely to feel a normal and appropriate amount of guilt when you do not do your duty or meet your obligations. You may sometimes judge others harshly, and you are likely to believe that a person's own mistakes and failings, as well as external circumstances, are both important reasons for their failures.`

`##### Industriousness`

`### 32nd percentile`

`Lower in industriousness than 67 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Very High in Industriousness`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **95th** percentile for industriousness. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in industriousness than **4** of them and higher in industriousness than **95** of them.`

`Your partner is very high in the aspect of industriousness. People who are very high in industriousness are highly likely to be successful in school and in administrative and managerial positions (particularly if they are intelligent). They value work very highly and typically want to be doing something useful. They are dutiful, and tend not to put things off. They do not often mess things up. They always finish what they start, and they do it on schedule. They are frequently figuring out how to accomplish more in less time, with fewer resources. They have significant focus.`

`Although people who are very high in industriousness tend to work hard, this trait also has its faults: they may judge others harshly, and they may be likely to believe people tend to fail due to their own mistakes and failings, rather than due to external circumstances. Very highly industrious people are also likely to judge shirkers or people who are incompetent quite harshly, and to want them out of the way. They are likely to believe that people fail because they don't apply themselves or work hard enough. They feel guilty, rapidly, if they do not do their duty. However, because they typically stay on or ahead of schedule and accept their responsibilities, they rarely experience actual guilt.`

`#####  Industriousness`

`### 95th percentile`

`Higher in industriousness than 95 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Industriousness as a Couple`

`You are typical in the aspect of industriousness and your partner is very high in the aspect of industriousness.`

`You and your partner are somewhat different in this aspect. This may present a problem to your relationship in accordance with the strength of the difference. You may find it difficult to understand each other's motivations, perceptions, and actions having to do with this aspect. A difference in one aspect can be mitigated by a better match on other traits and aspects, however.`

`Because your partner is very high in industriousness, he or she is likely to find it very easy to manage the household responsibilities, like paying the bills on time, maintaining the home, and errands and appointments. He or she will do so with extremely high efficiency and timeliness. You should also be able to do so reasonably well. Your partner will find it easy to support him or herself financially and to hold down a job, and you should be able to do so as well, although perhaps not always as well as your partner.`

`Your partner's life is likely to adhere to a strict schedule or routine, while you will enjoy a bit less structure from time to time. Your partner is likely to be significantly more proactive than reactive, while you are likely to balance being reactive and proactive. Your partner is very unlikely to show up late to engagements, while you may run late from time to time. Your partner will feel much more guilt than is perhaps ideal when he or she hurts you, while you will likely feel a normal amount of guilt in this situation.`

`You will be reasonably likely to be able to enjoy your time off work, and to unplug and relax during evenings, weekends, and while on vacation. Your partner may have significant trouble with this, and he or she can look to you for help. Your partner's temperament may encourage you to become more hard-working and efficient, and your temperament may encourage your partner to be a little more laid back.`

`You may occasionally judge your partner harshly for his or her failings, but this shouldn't happen with undue frequency. Your partner is likely to judge you harshly from time to time. You may sometimes see your partner as a bit high strung, and he or she might see you as a bit lazy from time to time, but the two of you should strike a good balance most of the time.`

`Orderliness`  
`-----------`

`Orderliness is an aspect of the big five factor conscientiousness. Simply put, it is a measure of how disturbed a person is by disorder -- whether it be a physical mess or a disorganized schedule. People who are higher in orderliness tend to like cleaning and organizing, to use lists, schedules and routines, and they prefer to control things rather than letting them happen. They are more judgmental in their attitude. People who are lower in orderliness tend not to mind messes, and they do not tend to plan their lives in much detail. They prefer to let things happen rather than to control them. They are less judgmental in their attitude.`

`### You are Low in Orderliness`

`Your score puts you at the **5th** percentile for orderliness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in orderliness than **94** of them and higher in orderliness than **5** of them.`

`You are low in the aspect of orderliness. This means you are not likely to be disturbed, disgusted, or upset by mess and chaos, compared to other people. You are more likely to see the world in shades of gray, rather than in a black-and-white manner. You are likely to be non-judgmental in your attitude toward others. You are not a planner, or someone who likes to use schedules and lists. You instead are likely to prefer to let things unfold without intervention. You are also not particularly detail-oriented, instead paying attention to the bigger picture.`

`#####  Orderliness`

`### 5th percentile`

`Lower in orderliness than 94 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Very High in Orderliness`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **98th** percentile for orderliness. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in orderliness than **1** of them and higher in orderliness than **98** of them.`

`Your partner is very high in orderliness. Very highly orderly people tend to be extremely disturbed and disgusted by mess and chaos. They keep everything tidy and organized. They tend to think in much more black and white terms: things are good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, with little room for grey areas. They make, like and stick to schedules. They want everything where it should be -- and want to make sure it stays where it belongs. They are very detail-oriented. They are highly rule-abiding, and tend to insist that rules are observed. They can be very judgmental towards themselves and others if and when rules are broken or procedures ignored. They do not like to be without routine and predictability. They can be very good at ensuring that complex, sensitive processes are managed properly and carefully. Excessive orderliness can also constrain creativity (even among those high in openness) as creative endeavors often require mess, disruption and intervening periods of chaos.`

`#####  Orderliness`

`### 98th percentile`

`Higher in orderliness than 98 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Orderliness as a Couple`

`You are low in the aspect of orderliness, and your partner is very high in the aspect of orderliness.`

`You and your partner are significantly different in this aspect. This may present a problem to your relationship in accordance with the strength of the difference. You may find it difficult to understand each other's motivations, perceptions, and actions having to do with this aspect. A difference in one aspect can be mitigated by a better match on other traits and aspects, however.`

`Because you are low or very low in orderliness, you are unlikely to be bothered by messes and disorder, although they will bother your partner a lot. The two of you will likely have different standards for housekeeping. Because your partner will notice messes much before you will, he or she is likely to do more of the cleaning around the house. Your partner may get annoyed at your messy tendencies, while you may get annoyed at your partner's obsessive cleaning.`

`You are likely to be non-judgmental in your attitude toward yourself, your partner, and others, while your partner is likely to be at least somewhat judgmental. You may find your partner too controlling or too picky for your liking, and he or she may find you too disorganized and too laissez-faire in your attitude.`

`You are not likely to use schedules, lists, and routines to organize your life, instead preferring to let things unfold. Your partner will prefer to use schedules, lists, and routines, and will want to control things instead of letting them be. This is likely to be a source of some conflict.`

`Extraversion`  
`------------`

`Extraversion is a big five personality trait associated with positive emotion and an enthusiastic, assertive approach to the world. Extroverts tend to experience a lot of joy and excitement, particularly in social situations. Extraversion is commonly understood to be a social dimension of personality, because social status and interpersonal affiliation are some of the strongest human goals and rewards. Accordingly, extroverts are more likely to enjoy being the center of attention, and tend to want to have a lot of people around.`

`People who are high in extraversion make spontaneous, fun, and enthusiastic partners who are motivated to seek out excitement and thrills. People who are low in extraversion (also called introverts) need much less stimulation, and therefore seek out less social interaction. They make calm, quiet, and reserved partners.`

`Personality researchers have determined that there are two separable aspects of extraversion: enthusiasm and assertiveness. Enthusiasm is associated with positive emotion, the motivation to associate with others, and the tendency to seek stimulation and excitement. Assertiveness is associated with leadership, putting one's opinions forward, and the motivation to seek social status. We will first discuss your results for the trait of extraversion overall, and later its two aspects.`

`### You are Very High in Extraversion`

`Your score puts you at the **99th** percentile for extraversion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in extraversion than **0** of them and higher in extraversion than **99** of them.`

`You are very high in extraversion. People who are very high in extraversion make extremely talkative, optimistic, and fun partners. They really enjoy stimulation, and are typically energized by social interaction. They tend to seek out social contact, and do not enjoy time alone. As romantic partners, they are likely to enjoy spending time with their partners in social groups, rather than one-on-one. They will almost always play the role of the speaker, as opposed to the listener, in their relationships. They don't mind loud and stimulating surroundings, and will find quiet environments very dull, whether for living, working, or leisure. They are markedly more positive and optimistic in their evaluations of the past and future. They can be quite impulsive, and will speak and act before others, sometimes without thinking.`

`#####  Extraversion`

`### 99th percentile`

`Higher in extraversion than 99 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Very High in Extraversion`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **99th** percentile for extraversion. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in extraversion than **0** of them and higher in extraversion than **99** of them.`

`Your partner is very high in extraversion. People who are very high in extraversion make extremely talkative, optimistic, and fun partners. They really enjoy stimulation, and are typically energized by social interaction. They tend to seek out social contact, and do not enjoy time alone. As romantic partners, they are likely to enjoy spending time with their partners in social groups, rather than one-on-one. They will almost always play the role of the speaker, as opposed to the listener, in their relationships. They don't mind loud and stimulating surroundings, and will find quiet environments very dull, whether for living, working, or leisure. They are markedly more positive and optimistic in their evaluations of the past and future. They can be quite impulsive, and will speak and act before others, sometimes without thinking.`

`#####  Extraversion`

`### 99th percentile`

`Higher in extraversion than 99 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Extraversion as a Couple`

`You are very high in extraversion, and your partner is very high in extraversion.`

`As a couple, you are very high in extraversion. As such, your relationship will tend to embody the virtues and faults of very high extraversion in general.`

`You and your partner are similar in extraversion.`

`This means you are about equally talkative or quiet, assertive or timid, gregarious or unsociable, and enthusiastic or reserved, as well as equally impulsive or thoughtful, overbearing or unassuming, and loud or quiet.`

`Because you align closely in extraversion, you will have similar needs for stimulation and socializing. You'll understand each other's tolerance levels for stimulation, and will want to be in similar situations much of the time. Some negotiation will be necessary, but you should find it easy to agree on how much socializing you'll want to do as a couple -- in other words, how often you want to go out, spend time with others, and attend parties.`

`### Extraversion: Behavioral Roles`

`Although you are similar in extraversion, you may sometimes take on different roles in your relationship, even if your difference is very small. These behaviors may not all apply to your relationship, but understanding them is helpful both in the context of your relationship and in your relationships with others.`

`At times, one of you will be more enthusiastic, talkative, assertive and gregarious than the other partner. One of you may want to be with groups of people more often, and will be comparatively energized by social activity. The other partner may need less social contact, and will find it comparatively draining. This person will sometimes need more time alone (perhaps in nature). One partner may at times be more interested in planning and attending parties, telling jokes, being the center of attention, making people laugh, and talking. The other partner may speak less and keep to themselves more.`

`In your day-to-day life together, one of you may sometimes do most of the talking, and may sometimes dominate conversations. The other will tend to be better at listening. One of you may want to stay later at parties and to go out more. If your scores are very similar, you are likely to take turns in each role.`

`### Extraversion: Your Virtues and Faults as a Couple`

`Since you are both very high in extraversion, your life together will be extremely social. You will talk a lot together, keep each other laughing, and spend a lot of time planning parties and other social events. However, you are also likely to be quite impulsive and may put excitement, socializing and other forms of fun before everything else (particularly if one or both of you is also low in conscientiousness). For example, you may let important obligations fall to the wayside if you're always out of the house or socializing.`

`You also might be unreasonably optimistic about the future (particularly if one or both of you is low in neuroticism, and/or conscientiousness). You may be prone to drug and alcohol use, and impulsive overspending. You will have to keep each other's highly excitable tendencies in check. You each may also find yourself spending too much time with other people to pay attention to your partner, or to think and work alone. You will have to encourage each other to strike a balance between socializing and spending time alone. You are likely to have a very large, strong and bustling social network around you, and your lives will be fun and social.`

`In your sex life together, you are both likely to desire sensation and thrills, as opposed to a more subdued sex life. People who are high in extraversion tend to be interested in having many partners, to be sensation seekers, and to use alcohol to fuel their sex life. A higher score in extraversion also predicts infidelity, although other personality factors and choices affect this behavior.`

`In the workplace, you are both highly likely to enjoy working in teams or groups, or in a social setting. It is often easier to match the job to the temperament, and not vice-versa. Many socially isolating jobs will be too draining for you, so it's a good idea to find something manageable that matches your ability.`

`You are both very likely to engage in impulsive overspending. People who are high in extraversion find it easier to spend money. You are also both extremely likely to be spenders rather than savers. It is important to remember that other personality traits affect a couple's financial decisions as well.`

`Enthusiasm`  
`----------`

`Enthusiasm is an aspect of the big five factor extraversion. Enthusiasm is a measure of a person's motivation to affiliate with other people, their tendency to show their positive emotion, and whether they seek stimulation and excitement. People who are higher in enthusiasm are excitable, happy, and bubbly. They laugh and smile more than others, and people find them communicative and easy to get to know. People who are lower in enthusiasm are more reserved and more neutral in their emotion. They laugh and smile less than others, and people tend to find them more difficult to get to know.`

`### You are Very High in Enthusiasm`

`Your score puts you at the **98th** percentile for enthusiasm. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in enthusiasm than **1** of them and higher in enthusiasm than **98** of them.`

`You are very high in the aspect of enthusiasm. This means you are very excitable. You will tend strongly to show your feelings on your face, and you will talk a lot about many different things in social situations. You will laugh, giggle, and smile a lot. People will find you very communicative and easy to get to know. You are likely to enjoy parties and spending time with other people. You won't at all keep things private, and will open up to others. You will much prefer socializing to solitude, especially if you are low in neuroticism (negative emotion). You will have very high levels of positive emotion, and you are quite likely to seek out stimulation and excitement.`

`#####  Enthusiasm`

`### 98th percentile`

`Higher in enthusiasm than 98 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Very High in Enthusiasm`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **96th** percentile for enthusiasm. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in enthusiasm than **3** of them and higher in enthusiasm than **96** of them.`

`Your partner is very high in the aspect of enthusiasm. People who are very high in enthusiasm are quite excitable, happy and easy to get to know. They will talk rapidly about everything, particularly other people. They laugh or giggle much more than average. They very much want to be around people, and they love parties. They don't keep people at a distance, and keep very little private. They are very positive and optimistic. They communicate easily with other people. They like -- and sometimes crave -- stimulation, excitement, activity and fun. Highly enthusiastic people are gregarious, encouraging and people-loving, and they are remarkably positive about what might happen next.`

`#####  Enthusiasm`

`### 96th percentile`

`Higher in enthusiasm than 96 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Enthusiasm as a Couple`

`You are very high in the aspect of enthusiasm, and your partner is very high in the aspect of enthusiasm.`

`Because you align closely in the aspect of enthusiasm, you will each easily understand your partner's thoughts, interests, and ideas having to do with this aspect. You will be approximately equally likely or unlikely to pursue affiliation with others, to show your emotions, and to seek stimulation or excitement.`

`Because you are both very high in enthusiasm, you will both tend to be talkative, and to enjoy social situations. You are highly likely to enjoy going to parties and social events together. People will find you very easy to get to know, both individually and as a couple. You will each have relatively high amounts of positive emotion. You are very likely to show your emotion on your faces, by laughing and smiling a lot.`

`Your life together will be remarkably open to others. You will keep relatively little private, and will tend to share the details of your life with your friends. You are very likely to seek out sensation and excitement, as opposed to pursuing a quieter lifestyle.`

`Assertiveness`  
`-------------`

`Assertiveness is an aspect of the big five factor extraversion. Assertiveness is a measure of a person's motivation to put their ideas forward, influence others, and achieve social status. People who are higher in assertiveness tend to advance their own opinions, communicate in a captivating manner, and to climb to leadership roles within their communities. They are sometimes prone to acting impulsively, and may also be prone to heated arguments, especially if they are also disagreeable. People who are lower in assertiveness tend not to advance their own opinions, may communicate in a less dramatic, less captivating manner, and are not particularly interested in leadership or social status within their communities, although they can still be good leaders.`

`### You are Very High in Assertiveness`

`Your score puts you at the **98th** percentile for assertiveness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in assertiveness than **1** of them and higher in assertiveness than **98** of them.`

`You are very high in the aspect of assertiveness. This means you are highly likely to want to dominate and control social situations, and to advance your own opinions. You're likely to be a take-charge type, and you will excel at acting decisively. You are likely to be very captivating and influential in social situations. You will use the communication style associated with leadership, and this can help you succeed in the business world. You may, however, act impulsively or without thinking more often than others.`

`#####  Assertiveness`

`### 98th percentile`

`Higher in assertiveness than 98 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Very High in Assertiveness`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **99th** percentile for assertiveness. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in assertiveness than **0** of them and higher in assertiveness than **99** of them.`

`Your partner is very high in assertiveness. People who are very high in assertiveness are "take charge" types. They put their own opinions forward very strongly, and tend to dominate and control social situations. As romantic partners, this may mean they dominate arguments and discussions, especially if they are also disagreeable. Highly assertive people can be very influential and captivating. They have the communication style that is often associated with leadership. This is good when they are knowledgeable, competent and able, but not so good when they aren't. Highly assertive people are very much people of action. They don't generally wait for others to lead the way. They can be more impulsive than average, and can act without thinking.`

`#####  Assertiveness`

`### 99th percentile`

`Higher in assertiveness than 99 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Assertiveness as a Couple`

`You are very high in the aspect of assertiveness, and your partner is very high in the aspect of assertiveness.`

`Because you align closely in the aspect of assertiveness, you will each easily understand your partner's thoughts, interests, and ideas having to do with this aspect. You will be approximately equally interested or disinterested in putting your ideas forward, influencing others, and achieving social status.`

`Because you are both very high in assertiveness, you will both be "take charge" types. You will be able to make decisions when necessary. Because you are both very motivated to take charge and act decisively, this may cause some conflict in the relationship. You may clash about decisions, and will both argue your own points. This is not necessarily a bad thing however, and you will likely find such discussions stimulating. You may find yourself engaged in arguments frequently, although they may not be heated or unpleasant. You will be particularly prone to arguing if one of both of you is low in agreeableness.`

`You will both want to be the center of attention, and to act in a very captivating and influential manner when in social situations. You will both want to put forward your own opinions strongly in social situations. This could be a source of tension or competition between you, but you could also become a "power couple" who captivates and influences people together. You will both be able to communicate in such a way that helps you succeed in the business world. You will be able to make yourself known at work, and will therefore be able to get the credit you deserve.`

`You each may tend toward acting very impulsively, or acting without thinking. This tendency can lead to financial trouble if left unbridled.`

`Neuroticism`  
`-----------`

`Neuroticism is a big five personality trait associated with a person's propensity towards negative emotion, versus emotional stability. Simply put, neuroticism is a measure of your sensitivity to negative emotions such as pain, guilt, shame, sadness, irritability and defensive anger, fear and anxiety.`

`People who are high in neuroticism are prone to negative emotion. They frequently feel unhappy, anxious, and irritable. They may be less resilient when faced with problems in life. In the context of a romantic relationship, neurotic partners may be overly concerned about the possibility of negative outcomes such as breaking up, cheating, or being rejected, which ironically can put a strain on the relationship. People who are low in neuroticism are less prone to negative emotion. They are less likely to feel unhappy, anxious, or irritable. They are likely to be more resilient when faced with problems in life. As romantic partners, they are usually calm and easygoing, though sometimes to a fault.`

`Personality psychologists have determined that there are two separable aspects of neuroticism: withdrawal and volatility. Withdrawal has to do with anxiety and avoidance behaviors, while volatility is related to irritability and anger. In simple terms, people high in withdrawal are concerned that something bad might happen, while people high in volatility get upset when they perceive that something bad has happened. We will first discuss your results for the trait of neuroticism overall and, later, its two aspects.`

`### You are Very Low in Neuroticism`

`Your score puts you at the **5th** percentile for neuroticism. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in neuroticism than **94** of them and higher in neuroticism than **5** of them.`

`You are very low in neuroticism. People who are very low in neuroticism tend to be emotionally stable, and to experience less negative emotion. They may have a markedly more positive outlook on life, especially if they are also extroverted (high in positive emotion). They rarely focus on the negative elements, anxieties and uncertainties of the past, present and future. They very rarely feel sad, anxious, or upset. When they do feel this way, they are able to recover fairly easily. In the extreme, they may act carelessly or in a heedless manner, particularly when it comes to taking risks. They may also be described as less emotionally sensitive, which can be a problem with a low score in this trait. As romantic partners, they are usually calm and easygoing, though sometimes to a fault. When good things happen to them, people with very low levels of neuroticism can accept it, without questioning whether or not they deserved it. They are usually satisfied with their relationships and careers. They are very tolerant of stress, and can accept failure and setbacks as part of life.`

`#####  Neuroticism`

`### 5th percentile`

`Lower in neuroticism than 94 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Typical or Average in Neuroticism`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **56th** percentile for neuroticism. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in neuroticism than **43** of them and higher in neuroticism than **56** of them.`

`Your partner is typical in neuroticism. People who are typical in neuroticism have a balanced approach to the difficulties of the past, present and future, as well as to the state of their relationship. They experience an appropriate amount of negative emotion in response to stressful life situations. They tend to have normal levels of self-esteem, particularly when they are also average or above average in extraversion. They are not particularly at risk for developing anxiety disorders and depression, chronic stress, divorce, or health problems. People with average or typical levels of neuroticism are able to experience the consequences of success and to be appropriately satisfied in relationships and career. Average levels of neuroticism are associated with no more than average concern about mental and physical health, a typical number of physician and emergency room visits, and an expected degree of absenteeism at work and at school (unless accompanied by very low levels of conscientiousness).`

`##### Neuroticism`

`### 56th percentile`

`Higher in neuroticism than 56 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Neuroticism as a Couple`

`You are very low in neuroticism, and your partner is typical in neuroticism.`

`This means the two of you have fairly different strategies for dealing with the world, which can be beneficial for you as a couple. However, this may present a challenge within your relationship because you may have trouble understanding one another at times. You'll have to be careful to avoid the pitfalls of your respective personality traits.`

`You and your partner are somewhat different in neuroticism.`

`You may at times find it difficult to understand each other's motivations, perceptions, and actions. You will also differ in your evaluations of threat and danger, and you will sometimes disagree on how you should act because of this.`

`If you or your partner is high in neuroticism, it is good if the other partner's score is low. Two neurotic partners would likely face trouble both in their relationship and when dealing with the outside world, because of their tendency to set each other off emotionally. A partnership between two people who differ in neuroticism is in some ways easier to manage than a partnership between two people whose scores are high.`

`You can also use your differences to your advantage, each helping one another to develop the virtues of the opposite trait. Personality psychologists believe that differences in both aspects of neuroticism are linked to clusters of genetic differences. Although it is possible to develop one's personality over time, it's also necessary to accept your innate differences to some degree, especially when it comes to neuroticism.`

`### Neuroticism: Behavioral Roles`

`You are lower in neuroticism than your partner. You will tend to see your partner as anxious, overly-emotional, touchy, and insecure, but also as careful and cautious. Your partner will tend to see you as relaxed, easygoing, tolerant, and self-assured, though also potentially heedless and careless.`

`Your partner will be more sensitive to threat and danger, more quick to anger, and will experience more negative emotion than you will. He or she will be more sensitive to emotional pain, sadness, anger, fear, and anxiety than you will be.`

`At times, you may not understand why your partner is upset. You can help your partner by not taking it personally when he or she gets upset, staying calm, and by listening to his or her concerns, without ignoring him or her. Your comparative emotional stability will help keep your relationship stable, especially if your partner's score is much higher than yours.`

`It will also be useful for you to listen to your partner's cares and concerns, as he or she may detect genuine problems and dangers that someone with comparatively lower levels of neuroticism might miss.`

`You will be more likely to take on a listening, caring, and calming role in the relationship, especially if you are also agreeable. Your partner will be more likely to seek comfort and to raise concerns. Your partner will excel at keeping the two of you safe, but you may need to push your partner out of their comfort zone from time to time.`

`### Neuroticism: Your Virtues and Faults as a Couple`

`You are likely to feel much lower than average levels of negative emotion. Your partner will feel worried, anxious, and upset when it is appropriate, but will not often be disabled by negative emotion. The two of you may occasionally set each other off emotionally, but this shouldn't happen too often. Your relative stability will help keep the relationship stable.`

`You should both be able to calm yourselves down and manage your emotions most of the time. You will get upset with each other and with personal life events and situations now and then, but you shouldn't be too prone to worry, have your feelings hurt, or burst out irritably. You may occasionally enter into dangerous situations without appropriate caution, or miss possible risks because of your low negative emotion. You are unlikely to struggle with excessive jealousy. In your sex life together, neither of you is likely to be particularly self-conscious or to need excessive reassurance. People who are low in neuroticism are less likely to experience performance anxiety in the bedroom.`

`If and when you have children, you will be fairly sensible when it comes to risk. You will be more likely than your partner to allow your children to take risks, which will help facilitate their independence. However, you may at times expose them to unreasonable risks or dangerous situations. Your partner is likely to be more cautious than you, and may experience slightly more negative emotion or worry about your children. It will be important to find the right balance where you both feel your children are safe, but are also developing their independence.`

`Someone who is typical in neuroticism can usually cope with the demands of a fairly stressful job, although your partner may not be as well-suited to extremely stressful jobs. You are much more likely to be able to take on a stressful job, if you desire to, since you are usually able to keep your negative emotions in check. It's important to find work that matches your temperament, rather than the other way around. When it comes to the family finances, you may be more likely to make risky choices. Your partner's relatively higher negative emotion may help balance this tendency of yours.`

`Withdrawal`  
`----------`

`Withdrawal is an aspect of the big five factor neuroticism. Withdrawal is a measure of a person's tendency to experience negative emotions like sadness, doubt, and worry, to be calm (reversed) or anxious, and to withdraw from or avoid uncertain or unexpected situations. People who are higher in withdrawal tend to feel negative emotion more strongly and more often. They may be more likely to avoid uncertain or anxiety-provoking situations, unless they consciously counter this tendency. People who are lower in withdrawal tend to feel negative emotion less strongly and less often. They are likely to feel more comfortable in uncertain or anxiety-provoking situations, and unlikely to avoid them. Technically, withdrawal has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate passive avoidance.`

`### You are Very Low in Withdrawal`

`Your score puts you at the **1st** percentile for withdrawal. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in withdrawal than **98** of them and higher in withdrawal than **1** of them.`

`You are very low in the aspect of withdrawal. This means you are likely to be much calmer in new, threatening, complex, uncertain, or unexpected situations. You are far less likely than average to withdraw from or avoid such situations. You are very unlikely to experience anticipatory anxiety. You are likely to feel far lower levels of negative emotion such as sadness, loneliness, doubt, worry, self-consciousness, and disappointment. You will not be particularly sensitive to social rejection, and not easily hurt when rejected. When you do become hurt, frightened, or anxious, you are likely to recover relatively easily and quickly. You tend not to worry much, if at all.`

`#####  Withdrawal`

`### 1st percentile`

`Lower in withdrawal than 98 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Typical or Average in Withdrawal`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **41st** percentile for withdrawal. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in withdrawal than **58** of them and higher in withdrawal than **41** of them.`

`Your partner is typical in withdrawal. People who are typical in withdrawal may occasionally suffer from anticipatory anxiety, but are generally not impeded by it. They can handle new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations reasonably well. They are not more likely than average to avoid or withdraw in the face of the unknown and unexpected. People with medium levels of withdrawal sometimes feel sad, lonesome, disappointed and grief-stricken, but not too deeply, and not for too long. They experience normal levels of doubt and worry, embarrassment, self-consciousness and discouragement in the face of threat and punishment. They are not particularly likely to doubt their relationship, or to feel self-conscious or jealous around their partner, although that may occur at times. They are reasonably but not excessively sensitive to social rejection, and don't feel hurt too easily by others, including their partner. Even when hurt, frightened, or anxious, they can recover in a reasonable amount of time. People with typical levels of withdrawal are not particularly concerned that something bad is going to happen.`

`##### Withdrawal`

`### 41st percentile`

`Higher in withdrawal than 41 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Withdrawal as a Couple`

`You are very low in the aspect of withdrawal, and your partner is typical in the aspect of withdrawal.`

`You and your partner are somewhat different in this aspect. This may present a problem to your relationship in accordance with the strength of the difference. You may find it difficult to understand each other's motivations, perceptions, and actions having to do with this aspect. However, a difference in one aspect can be mitigated by a better match on other traits and aspects.`

`Because you are very low in withdrawal, you are likely to experience a lower frequency and intensity of negative emotion, including sadness, loneliness, doubt, worry, self-consciousness, and disappointment, in comparison to your partner. You will be quite calm in new, threatening, complex, uncertain, and unexpected situations. While your partner can usually handle such circumstances, he or she may sometimes struggle with them. You will be very unlikely to withdraw from difficult or challenging situations, while your partner may occasionally do so. You are unlikely to feel doubtful about the relationship, or self-conscious around your partner, and your partner is not likely to feel this way more than the average person. However, he or she may be more easily hurt than you, and will be more sensitive to social rejection. When your partner becomes hurt, frightened, or anxious, it will take him or her a typical amount of time to recover, while you will recover quickly and easily from these emotions. You are very unlikely to worry unduly about your partner or the relationship, and your partner is not particularly likely to do so, either -- although he or she may worry more than you.`

`Volatility`  
`----------`

`Volatility is an aspect of the big five factor neuroticism. Volatility is a measure of a person's mood stability, irritability, and their ability to regulate their emotions. People who score higher in volatility tend to vary in their moods. They are easily stirred up, and can be irritable. They can sometimes lose their composure, and tend to be prone to lashing out. People who score lower in volatility tend to vary less in their moods. Their moods are more predictable. They are difficult to stir up, and tend not to be irritable. They rarely lose their composure and are unlikely to lash out.`

`### You are Low in Volatility`

`Your score puts you at the **25th** percentile for volatility. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in volatility than **74** of them and higher in volatility than **25** of them.`

`You are low in the aspect of volatility. This means you are likely to be emotionally stable and to be predictable in your moods. You will likely feel less frustration, pain, and loneliness than average. You are unlikely to be irritable, or to take this out on others, including your partner. People, including your partner, will find you relaxing to be around. You will not be easily stirred up, and will not become angry with your partner easily. When you do, you will likely calm down quickly. You will rarely lose your composure, and will not tend to lash out at your partner, although you will react if provoked.`

`##### Volatility`

`### 25th percentile`

`Lower in volatility than 74 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Typical or Average in Volatility`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **68th** percentile for volatility. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in volatility than **31** of them and higher in volatility than **68** of them.`

`Your partner is typical in volatility. People who are typical in volatility tend not to vary abnormally in their mood. They are not particularly irritable, and feel no more than typical levels of disappointment, frustration, pain and social isolation. They express their frustration, disappointment and irritability reasonably and not excessively often. Even when stirred up and upset or angry or irritated, they calm down relatively quickly. They are no more argumentative than average and infrequently lose their composure around their partner. If provoked in a dispute, a person of average volatility may react in kind (particularly if also low in agreeableness). However, such people generally remain calm and unperturbed, even when stressed.`

`##### Volatility`

`### 68th percentile`

`Higher in volatility than 68 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Volatility as a Couple`

`You are low in the aspect of volatility, and your partner is typical in the aspect of volatility.`

`You and your partner are slightly different in this aspect. This may present a problem to your relationship at times, although your difference is not very big. You may find it difficult to understand each other's motivations, perceptions, and actions having to do with this aspect. A slight difference in one aspect can be mitigated by a better match on other traits and aspects, however.`

`Because you are low in volatility, you will be emotionally stable and your moods will be predictable. Your partner will also be fairly emotionally stable, and his or her moods will vary in an approximately average way. Neither of you will be particularly irritable, with one another or people outside the relationship. You will feel low levels of frustration, pain, and loneliness, and your partner will feel these emotions with average frequency and intensity. When you express these feelings, you will do so reasonably. Neither of you will be particularly easily stirred up, and you should have mostly calm discussions together. Occasionally, your partner may get more stirred up than you, but your calm nature should help temper this tendency. When you get stirred up, it will be relatively easy for both of you to calm down. Overall, your relationship should be comparatively stable.`

`Openness to Experience`  
`----------------------`

`Openness to experience is a big five personality trait associated with creativity, artistic interest, and intelligence. Openness to experience is a measure of a person's interest in novelty, art, literature, abstract thinking, and philosophy as well as their sensitivity to aesthetic emotions and beauty. Research shows that openness is fairly assortative, which means that couples tend to align on this dimension of personality.`

`Personality psychologists have determined that there are two separable aspects of openness to experience: intellect and aesthetics. Aesthetics is associated with the aesthetic, creative, and visionary aspect of openness to experience. Intellect is associated with interest in ideas, curiosity, and abstract thought. We will first discuss your results for the trait of openness overall, and later its two aspects.`

`### You are Very High in Openness To Experience`

`Your score puts you at the **95th** percentile for openness to experience. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in openness to experience than **4** of them and higher in openness to experience than **95** of them.`

`You are very high in openness to experience. People who are very high in openness to experience make very intellectual, creative, and interesting partners. You will very much enjoy learning and acquiring new abilities and skills, sometimes with your partner. You are very curious and exploratory, as opposed to conservative and conventional. You are not likely to follow social norms when it comes to your role in the relationship just because they are social norms. You are very likely to enjoy complex, abstract discussions with your romantic partner. You are likely to be interested in many things, and can think and learn quickly.`

`#####  Openness to Experience`

`### 95th percentile`

`Higher in openness to experience than 95 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Typical or Average in Openness To Experience`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **64th** percentile for openness to experience. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in openness to experience than **35** of them and higher in openness to experience than **64** of them.`

`Your partner is typical in openness to experience. People who are typical in openness to experience are sometimes conservative and conventional, but also sometimes creative and exploratory, in relationships and otherwise. They will be appropriately interested in change and in shaking things up in the relationship, but also know the value of routine and familiarity. They may follow social norms when it comes to their role in the relationship, but may also be open to doing things in unconventional ways. They may enjoy complex and abstract discussions with their partner from time to time, but also sometimes prefer to discuss things at a more practical and concrete level. People with typical levels of openness to experience are about as creative as the average person, and they tend to have a normal range of interests. They are not overwhelmingly curious, and are not strikingly interested in abstract thinking, philosophy, or the meaning of belief systems and ideologies. People with typical levels of openness tend to be adaptable, and can connect with people on either extreme of this trait.`

`##### Openness to Experience`

`### 64th percentile`

`Higher in openness to experience than 64 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Openness to Experience as a Couple`

`You are very high in openness to experience, and your partner is typical in openness to experience.`

`This means the two of you have fairly different strategies for dealing with the world, which can be beneficial for you as a couple. However, this may present a challenge within your relationship because you may have trouble understanding one another at times. You'll have to be careful to avoid the pitfalls of your respective personality traits. However, your relationship is fairly balanced in this trait overall.`

`You and your partner are somewhat different in openness to experience.`

`You may sometimes find it difficult to understand each other's motivations, perceptions, and actions. You may also sometimes have trouble finding shared interests and topics of discussion, though likely not often.`

`You can use your slight differences to your advantage, each helping one another to develop the virtues of the opposite trait. Personality psychologists believe that differences in both aspects of openness to experience are linked to clusters of genetic differences. Although it is possible to develop one's personality over time, it's also necessary to accept your innate differences to some degree. Expecting your partner to change often leads to frustration.`

`### Openness To Experience: Behavioral Roles`

`You are higher in openness to experience than your partner. You are likely to see your partner as dull, predictable, conventional, and narrow. Your partner is likely to see you as difficult to understand, eccentric, over-intellectual, impractical, unpredictable and "out there".`

`You will be more interested in ideas, artistic endeavors, and cultural and political events than your partner. You will be more likely to see yourself as creative, and more likely to be viewed that way by others as well. You are also more likely to be politically liberal than your partner is.`

`Your partner will be more interested in concrete topics of conversation, such as the actions of people in the immediate neighborhood and the local cares of the day. Compared to you, your partner will not be as interested in fantasizing, or day-dreaming, or art, or literature, or culture, or politics, or ideas.`

`### Openness To Experience: Your Virtues and Faults as a Couple`

`When spending time together, you may find you have somewhat different interests, although you should still be able to find shared interests. You'll be a bit more interested in creative pursuits like art, music, and dance, as well as intellectual pursuits like reading, writing, programming, and mathematics, while your partner will be more interested in practical, concrete and conventional activities. Your conversations may also be a bit difficult because of this: you will want to discuss things at a more abstract level, while your partner may sometimes prefer to discuss practicalities, at a somewhat more concrete level. He or she should also be able to discuss things at an abstract level, however.`

`The two of you are likely to prefer different kinds of friends. You are likely to make friends with other people who are high in openness to experience, while your partner is likely to make friends with other people who are typical in openness to experience. Having friends who are compatible with each of you personally may make it easier for the two of you to negotiate your difference on this trait.`

`In your sex life together, you are likely to be interested in trying new things. You may be interested in sexual experimentation. Your partner is likely to be a bit less comfortable with this. He or she will want to balance routine and conformity to social norms with novelty and chaos.`

`When it comes to religion, your partner is more likely to stick to the tradition he or she was raised in, or to avoid traditional religion altogether. He or she may, however, show some interest in different religions and spiritual experiences. You are much more likely to be interested in different philosophies and traditions than your partner is, and you may explore a variety of different spiritual experiences.`

`If and when you have children, your partner will have a balanced approach to tradition and novelty. You are significantly more likely to expose your children to new ideas, art, and experiences, but may be less sensible and practical where that counts.`

`Intellect`  
`---------`

`Intellect is an aspect of the big five factor openness to experience. It measures a person's interest in ideas and abstract concepts. People who are higher in intellect tend to be more curious, more verbally adept, with a richer vocabulary, and more interested in learning, while those who are lower in intellect tend to be less curious, less verbally adept, and less interested in learning.`

`Importantly, the personality aspect of intellect is not the same as a person's intelligence, or IQ. Intellect is a measure of interest in abstract ideas, essentially, while IQ is a measure of processing speed, verbal ability, working memory, and problem solving capacity, and is better measured with a formal IQ test. It is perfectly possible, although somewhat rare, to have a high IQ and a low score on the personality trait of intellect (or the reverse). Intellect is best thought of as an attitude or set of interests rather than an ability.`

`### You are High in Intellect`

`Your score puts you at the **92nd** percentile for intellect. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in intellect than **7** of them and higher in intellect than **92** of them.`

`You are high in the aspect of intellect. People who are high in the aspect of intellect make interesting and intellectually stimulating partners. You will enjoy talking about ideas, and will want to engage in complex, philosophical discussions with your partner. You will be quick to understand new ideas and situations, because of your interest in doing so, and may get frustrated with those who don't figure things out as quickly as you do. You are likely to have a rich vocabulary.`

`#####  Intellect`

`### 92nd percentile`

`Higher in intellect than 92 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is High in Intellect`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **78th** percentile for intellect. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in intellect than **21** of them and higher in intellect than **78** of them.`

`Your partner is high in the aspect of intellect. People who are high in intellect are quite interested in ideas and abstract concepts. They make intellectually stimulating partners. They enjoy being confronted with novel information, even when it is complex. They are substantially more curious and exploratory than average, and frequently like to tackle and solve problems. They will actively engage in and seek out and initiate issue-oriented discussions, and are likely to read, think about and want to discuss idea-centered books (most frequently non-fiction). They are generally articulate and can formulate ideas clearly and quickly (particularly if they are average or higher in extraversion). They have a wide vocabulary, and actively enjoy learning new things. People who are high in intellect will often find and generate novel, creative concepts and voluntarily search for and adapt well to new experiences and situations.`

`#####  Intellect`

`### 78th percentile`

`Higher in intellect than 78 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Intellect as a Couple`

`You are high in the aspect of intellect, and your partner is high in the aspect of intellect.`

`Because you align closely in the aspect of intellect, you will each easily understand your partner's thoughts, interests, and ideas having to do with this aspect. You will be approximately equally interested in ideas.`

`Because you are both high in intellect, you are likely to enjoy discussing ideas and abstract concepts together. You are both likely to enjoy learning, and to actively seek out novel information, and perhaps to share this with your partner. You are both likely to be curious and exploratory, and to want to solve abstract problems. You may connect over your love of ideas, information, and problem-solving. You should feel like you can enjoy conversation with your partner most of the time.`

`Each of you is likely to be highly articulate, and to formulate ideas quickly and clearly. This means you will be likely to communicate well together, and will be a fair match for each other in your discussions.`

`You are both likely to desire more complex and rapidly-changing jobs, as opposed to stable, straightforward, and more traditional occupations. You will both be prone to boredom if forced to work in these circumstances. The fact that each of you is likely to pursue complex careers may cause some conflict about whose career takes priority.`

`Aesthetics`  
`----------`

`Aesthetics is an aspect of the big five factor openness to experience. It measures a person's creativity and interest in aesthetic experience. People who are higher in the aspect of aesthetics tend to be artistic, creative, and sensitive to beauty. People who are lower in the aspect of aesthetics tend to be less artistic, less creative, and less sensitive to beauty.`

`### You are High in Aesthetics`

`Your score puts you at the **90th** percentile for aesthetics. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in aesthetics than **9** of them and higher in aesthetics than **90** of them.`

`You are high in the aspect of aesthetics. The closest synonym for this aspect is creativity. People who score higher in aesthetics are creative, artistic, imaginative, and reflective, although they can also sometimes be impractical and unusual. You are likely to require a creative outlet, and you will find beauty very important.`

`#####  Aesthetics`

`### 90th percentile`

`Higher in aesthetics than 90 of 100 people`

`### Your Partner is Typical or Average in Aesthetics`

`Your partner's score puts them at the **44th** percentile for aesthetics. If your partner was one of 100 people in a room, your partner would be lower in aesthetics than **55** of them and higher in aesthetics than **44** of them.`

`Your partner is typical in the aspect of aesthetics. The closest synonym for this aspect is creativity. People who are average in aesthetics or creativity find beauty reasonably important. They may enjoy an outlet for their creative ability, but will not wither away without it. They can appreciate art or beautiful crafts. They are somewhat sensitive to color and architectural form. They sometimes enjoy collecting, but it is rare for them to pursue it passionately. They are reasonably imaginative, and may daydream and reflect on occasion. They tend to enjoy music, often of the more conventional popular forms, and may be somewhat musical or artistic themselves (both of these are rare in the general population). They do not generally become so immersed in a book, or a movie, or in their own thoughts, that they lose touch with the outside world. They are interested in but by no means obsessed with beauty, creativity and art.`

`##### Aesthetics`

`### 44th percentile`

`Higher in aesthetics than 44 of 100 people`

`### Implications of Aesthetics as a Couple`

`You are high in the aspect of aesthetics and your partner is typical in the aspect of aesthetics.`

`You and your partner are slightly different in the aspect of aesthetics. You may occasionally find it difficult to understand each other's motivations, perceptions, and actions having to do with this aspect. You may also sometimes have trouble finding shared interests and topics of discussion because of this. A slight difference in one aspect can be mitigated by a better match on other traits and aspects, however.`

`Because you are high in the aspect of aesthetics, you are likely to require a creative outlet, while your partner may or may not. You will be more likely to daydream or reflect than your partner, although he or she may do so at times. You are likely to find it important to be surrounded by beauty and art, while your partner may be indifferent.`

`Because you are high in the aspect of aesthetics, you may have strange mental experiences from time to time, and may also think in unusual ways. Your partner will be somewhat less likely to have these experiences. His or her somewhat more straightforward thinking style may prove helpful, however. You may also be interested in occult, new-age, or unconventional ideas having to do with spirituality. Your partner may dabble in them.`

`People who are high in the aspect of aesthetics are more likely to experiment with drugs (in particular, psychedelic drugs). Since your partner is typical in aesthetics, he or she will have a typical propensity to experiment with drugs, but your influence may make them more likely to do so.`
