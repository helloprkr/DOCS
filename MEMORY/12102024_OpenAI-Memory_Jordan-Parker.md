Jordan is focusing on marketing, copywriting, and the intersection of these areas with a new website on Webflow for Carly Pollack's personal brand. The goal is to optimize for conversions and emotional resonance with an ideal customer avatar. Jordan wants to craft the most optimized, natural, on-brand, and conversion-optimized copywriting for each page individually and holistically across the board.

Jordan is focusing on creating a template for perfect, on-brand copywriting for websites, aiming to reverse engineer the process from an ideal end result provided by O1-preview. The objective is to develop a meta-template that does not require crafting the business context but focuses on the structural approach to achieving flawless copywriting.

Jordan prefers using a structured prompt methodology that integrates first principles and analysis for copywriting, focusing on accurate data, on-brand vocabulary, and on-style writing, with a North Star of precision and brand alignment. Jordan aims for a high level of clarity and connected thought when transforming analysis into actionable copywriting frameworks.

Jordan is utilizing AnthropX's console, dashboard, and workbench, with a focus on leveraging its tags and variables for managing prompts. Jordan prefers a code-heavy approach for the initial prompt to be processed by LLMs, assuming all analyzed data, strategies, problem-solving, and outcomes are already embedded in the dataset available to models like 01-preview or Claude 3.5. This code-heavy approach should assume Carly Pollack's context as the foundational data, with her website (www.carlypollack.com), private practice (www.nutritionalwisdom.com), her book, and customer data as key reference points. All prompts should integrate this locked-in data.

Include Claude 3.5 from Anthropic as an area of interest for Jordan in the current project. Track the intersections of the following concepts: Various AI models: bolt.new (similar to Cursor.ai), Cursor.ai, OpenAI's models, Anthropic's models, specifically the new 3.5, and Anthropic's computer use.

Jordan is working on an app idea for an automated MVP generator and project manager. The app is described as a system that automates the creation of MVPs from app ideas and manages their development lifecycle. The core features include a Daily Database Crawler that scans a note-taking database for new app ideas, integrates with a Notion-like interface for idea input, and uses shadcn/ui for modern, clean styling. Jordan also wants an automated system for personal use that logs app ideas through a website with Google Authenticator. Each night, automation should push ideas to Bolt for development through ten cycles, creating an MVP for each idea in fresh repositories to review the following day. Each MVP generated should include a top-quality README.md file following GitHub standards, with sections for value proposition, technical architecture, developmental insights, future improvements, deployment SOP, and creator notes. For each new idea, Jordan wants the generated MVP to be stored as a repository within the main meta project of this concept. The purpose of the 10-prompt sequence for Jordan's automation project is to refine an app idea progressively, starting with a concept dropped into Bolt.new as the first prompt. The following nine prompts guide Bolt to make the app functional and enhance its UI within the limited prompts, with each prompt indicating the remaining cycles. After the 10 rounds, the repository is updated with the final MVP version.

Jordan has a Webflow development and designer portfolio and account.

Jordan wants to focus on repurposing tech components from Geek Bar vape cartridges in a way that doesn't require the end users to be tech-oriented. The aim is to find creative uses for these components, considering that vape users might have many vapes around, rather than focusing on the technical expertise of the consumers.

Add to the intersection list the compounding practicality of accumulating multiple vape cartridges over time. This includes systemizing the use of an increasing number of vapes to benefit the overall design or concept.

Jordan is exploring the idea of a business model where vape shops offer customers the option to donate a small amount when purchasing a vape, which would then contribute to collecting used vape cartridges for repurposing. This model aims to gather raw materials from the top vape brands in the United States without burdening consumers. Potential methods include partnerships with vape shops for collection or hiring contractors to pick up used cartridges from stores. The goal is to create a low-friction process for acquiring these materials for innovative reuse.

Jordan prefers responses to be spoken at 2.5x to 3.5x normal speed, while maintaining concise and quick answers. Jordan would rather have brief pauses for processing than slower speech.

Jordan is reviewing information about running models like Llama3 on various platforms, including Raspberry Pi 5, and exploring lightweight AI models for practical use.

Jordan's current business plan involves sourcing raw materials from used vapes through buyback programs with vape shops. The plan is to combine raw components with recent software/AI advances, such as Raspberry Pi hardware and linking to LLMs, to create a DTC product that balances high value with low effort/cost. The target customer avatar is still being identified, and the focus is on exploring pain points and solutions to flesh out the ideal customer and product fit.

Jordan provides visual assets like images and screenshots for content review and improvement.

Materials referencing the 'End Emotional Eating Blueprint' (EEE and/or Blueprint) should be removed from the knowledge base and all future responses. Focus strictly on authentic, nuanced, and specific messaging related to the 'Sugar Reset' course. All focus, facts, figures, goals, and communication should remain centered on the 'Sugar Reset' course.

The last email written for the 'Sugar Reset' campaign is considered the lowest acceptable standard of writing. All future content must meet or exceed this level of quality, characterized by a sophisticated, nuanced, and authentic style that remains realistic and unhyperbolic. Jordan prefers the previous version of Email #01 for the 'Sugar Reset' campaign. Going forward, the copywriting should avoid the formula of contrasting an incorrect belief with the 'real' or 'new' approach (e.g., 'It's not about X; it's about Y' or 'This isn’t just another diet or detox.'). This tactic is no longer acceptable in the writing. Future content must be strictly in line with the sophisticated, nuanced, and authentic style required, staying realistic and avoiding overused or formulaic approaches. All content should focus on the unique value of the 'Sugar Reset' course without framing it against misconceptions.

Jordan is looking for a world-class marketing playbook for launching a 'Sugar Reset' small-group coaching course on carlypollack.com and nutritionalwisdom.com.
